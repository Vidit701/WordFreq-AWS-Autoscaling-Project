But I believe this book is better, because Sam Damon puts his duty to his country ahead of everything. This should be required reading in schools so that the citizens in our country will know that war is possible and horrible. The only remedy is preparation and vigilance. It is apalling that our military cannot even enlist the required number of men it needs to keep up to strength. It is apalling that our country lacks a missle defense system to protect our shores. We can thank the ultimate Courtenay Massengale-William Jefferson Clinton and the other ignorant social welfare planners of his ilk. We all need to do our duty as citizens to force the politicians to do what is right.",
40002,__label__2,"Interesting Novel About Leadership and the Military: Right from the start, I was engrossed in Sam Damon's character and the storyline of this novel. It starts with a small town boy who decides to make his career in the Army and follows him through WWI, peacetime, and WWII. Damon enlists and then is made an officer through a wartime commission. Its a compelling storyline, but most of all I found its inner-woven leadership lessons to be the most interesting aspect of the book. Sam gets presented with tough choices over and over again and finds a way to make the right decision each time. Yes, its not realistic, but it does teach important lessons. For a young military officer, this is definitely worth the read. For a very long book, it does go fairly quickly. However, it was about 300 pages too long. I lost interest about 3/4 of the way through and couldn't finish. Overall a very good novel.",

It should be required reading in business school as well as West Point.

As a career enlisted soldier, I recognizes both protaganists and the stage on which they play. It's a great exposition of the trials and tribulations of the Army in peace and war, and of an officer's struggle to survive long enough to make a difference when the balloon goes up.

If you want propaganda reading material, read this novel. That's why the Army/USMC likes it so much: it stresses the core values of the modern military.

The dialog is insipid. The character development is shallow, much like the science fiction genre. There is not much action. It is a pokey, slow moving book that offers little else except perhaps a depiction of military life and action that is accurate enough to please those who have been there.

This homicide, the island's first, rocks the community, shaking loose endemic anti-Semitism and racism.

Certainly one does not have to tidy things up all the time but to purposely have people act out of character is unforgivable sin for an author. I very much cared for the individuals in this book and at the end felt very manipulated by the author. Do not read this book.",

In the case of Sloan's book, however, she has managed to mix an improbable plot and wooden characters together with a prose style that is, frankly, amateurish. I didn't buy it. Furthermore I wonder if she is really at all interested in spinning us a good yarn, or is there some sort of murky political agenda here? I can even accept agendas if they're presented well, I would even be inclined to sympathize with this one, if it's there. But it's all so over the top, and she leaves too many loose ends in the plot: the most glaring is why the teacher's car was seen at the murder site (she's managed to eliminate every similar car on the island, so it must have been his). Maybe Sloan should try another line of work.",

I am a non-white person living in a small community in the Northwest (about 2 hours from Seattle) with very little crime. While I have never experienced blatant racism, I have encountered some innocent/ignorant comments from people who were not hatefull; I'm assuming they were just not very culturally aware, so I can relate to many of the situations/feelings in the book. This is not a story with a happy ending; rather, it was sad (police chief and detective's relationship) as well as disturbing (altering crime evidence, guilt by association, hidden racial and militia agendas). It would seem to be a book to spark discussion groups on these multiple themes. I will read the author's first novel.",

This is not a mystery to solve but a drama of prejudice and racism, and I found the ending left a bitter taste.

Instead, I found myself half-way through the novel wondering if I should discard it, or hope for the best. It takes forever to start, the characters, once developed are so flawed and unlikable that it simply turns to a disappointment. The ""good"" guys turn into a new form of ""bad"". BTW, this is a murder mystery, and when she finally gets to wrapping it up, the ending and the motive for the murder are swept under the carpet.

The saxophonist, Jan Garbarek, however seems to be an acquired taste-his horn sounds like a loon across a frozen lake. Be that as it may, I didn't enjoy his solos as I normally would any other sax man. The normally dependable Charlie Haden is almost inaudible here.

There is a masterful talent and a visionary mind behind this work; the coupling of Garbarek's artic saxophone with the warmer strings, Jarrett's stunning piano work place it among the better works of the time.From the first statement of quivering strings on Runes, to the nearly triumphant Solara March, Arbour Zena is a sustained and cohesive vision that nourishes the mind and replenishes idealism.

I loved that Lottie's personality hadn't changed from ""A Kiss to Remember"" because if it had, the book would have turned out dull.

Expand your thinking. There are alot of stories that can be told around the elements of Halloween, without Michael being turned into some out of this world cult pawn.

Michael Myers, whose relentless earnestness made the first two films horror classics, is conspicuously absent, instead replaced by a ridiculous premise about children being converted into monsters by wearing ""Silver Shamrock"" Halloween masks. The final twenty minutes or so of the film inundate the viewer with a thoroughly annoying, synthesized jingle for the Silver Shamrock company that is memorable because it is some of the most pathetically cheesy music ever to be captured on celluloid. The only things that are scary about this movie are that John Carpenter put his name on it and a movie company actually mass marketed it.

Although lacking cities of gold the Americas did have sophisticated technology in some tribes, even more ahead than their un familiar rivals in Europe.

40432,__label__1,"Revisionism at Its Best: Mann's book, while entertaining, is nothing more than speculative revisionism. The book does not read very easily because it jumps around from one topic to the next without warning frequently. Mann's intentions may have been good, but it doesn't excuse the fact that you can't rewrite history simply to promote an idealistic view of native cultures based on circumstantial evidence. He offers no hard facts to promote his patronizing image of Native American civilizations prior to Europeanization. Nonetheless I enjoyed the book because it does offer some new or ""fresh"" perspectives into Native American cultures prior to (but mainly after) 1492, but I treated it more as fictional entertainment rather than an authentic historical account.",

The dense forests of thousand year old redwoods and sitka spruce which greeted European immigrants in the Pacific Northwest were not products of American Indian slash and burn, or other agricultural management techniques. It seems that by ignoring the greater portion of North American environmental history during his narrative, it was easier for Mann to make his somewhat remedial, politically motivated point.",

All sorts of opposing views are treated with respect - letting the reader sort out the wheat and shaff given the evidences presented. I lapped it up!Occassionally the book bogged down into so much detail that it was distracting - I wanted to shout ""Get on with it!"" I think the points could have been made in half the space.

By the time European settlers arrived perhaps more than 90% of the residents had died due to the influx of contagious diseases spread among them. And much had changed in the century or so as farmed forests became overgrown and formerly heavily hunted populations of animals, such as bison and pigeons, grew way out of hand. The settlers never realized that there were so many people formerly resident and that so much was already ""managed"". Great fun and great stuff. I especially liked the section on the Amazon, which so many thought was uninhabitable by large groups.

Had I not read various articles in Scientific American and books such as ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"", I think I would have doubted most of what is in Mr. Mann's book.The book flows fairly well and is not too technical. I would guess it appeals mostly to people who like details and stories that dive far below the surface. The author does this well and introduces us to people on the way.

Anyway, I just received it today and I am quite excited. The parachute is actually 10 feet in diameter and has 12 handles. So it is much larger than I had originally expected.

A Wizard Abroad is a stupendous read, but I would recommend reading it prior to reading High Wizardry, or else it will leave you wanting more. Also, not to criticize Ms. Duane, but she left Nita's relationship with Ronan too open-ended; it was sad, the way she left it.",

And there are many things i hated about it i'll give you five examples. 1. There are few spells in it. 2. The spells where weak and pitiful. 3. Everyone is a wizard. 4. There are few battles. 5.

When Nita's parents decide she needs a vacation from her magic and her friend Kit, they ship her off to Ireland to visit her Aunt. Her magic(and the Powers that Be), however, has other ideas. Nita manages to get mixed up in yet another battle with the Lone Power--this one, however, parallels Celtic mythology, probably one of the reasons I found this one so fascinating. NIta and Kit are here, along with some new, very interesting characters--including a cat bard. It's a fast-paced, enjoyable book that I highly recommend.",

In truth this should have been his story, and He, not Nita, should have been the one to tell it.As it is we get the view from the outside, with a narrator who isn't quite perseptive enough to give us the whole story. And if Nita's place in this story is somewhat periperal then the other young wizards from the previous books are even more so.Kit is the proverbial 3rd wheel, and Dairine is used as nothing more then a convnient power source.I loved the first two books inis series, was disappointed by the third and am sad to say that the story line hasn't recovered in the Fourth. Like its imediat predesor this book feels like the darkness has delibertly been toned down, and frequently omitted, preferring to report the fighting with passages about what Nita remembered rather than dropping us into the thick of it.As a result I just couldn't find anything to get involved with in this story,",

The young human wizards of this world suffer from diminished powers as they grow older, so as Nita and Kit mature they become more interesting as characters but less interesting as wizards. In fact, they do very little wizarding here (as in HIGH WIZARDRY, Nita's little sister Dairine remains the champion power spellcaster).Nevertheless, Duane's picture of contemporary and legendary Ireland is fascinating, as are her incidental characters. Did anyone else figure out who Aunt Annie is?",

Lewis still has his acrid and acerbic view of American life - he skewers Minnesota and New York City with equal ease. However, he seems to see, at the end of his career, that there is some redemptive moment in life. True, you might find this rather sentimental, but I see it as a synthesis of his earlier Menckenism with the later romance of the swing era. Indeed, this book has many elements of the twenties, but they are tempered by the forties. Having just read Wolfe's Of Time and the River, I noticed that Wolfe was apparently influenced by Lewis. Even as Wolfe surpassed Lewis in achievement, he also brought his novels to a resolution that left an impression of hope and survival.",

He can also sit up inside the tunnel without a problem being that he is still younger.

One of the velcro tabs used to keep the coils together when storing it fell off so it no longer folded up flat.

The problem is that the shelf does not fit tightly to the peg, which makes the shelf a little wobbly. It slopes down towards you instead of being perfectly straight. That is, if you put a marble in the middle it would slowly come back to you instead of sitting in the middle.Also, I bought two of these and one was defective. The peg didn't fit into the shelf because it was not cut properly. I called customer service at the company to request a new peg and they said they would ship a new shelf.

Top that off with what literally looks like dirt and dust the director forgot to wash off the film reel, and you get a ho-hum movie that's probably only worth watching for the fight scenes.",

The first, be completely ignorant of the history of the Roman Empire and enjoy it for the great heroic epic it is. The second (and way I chose) is to just ignore the errors, suspend disbelief, and enjoy it for the heroic epic it is. Either way, as action, Gladiator can't be beat. I even almost forgave that dog Crowe for messing around with a married woman (believe me Dennis, you're better off without her). Crowe is close to perfect in the title role (if a bit flabby - Arnold would have been too big). Richard Harris makes even over acting look good. And Oliver Reed is a joy to watch. Joaquin Phoenix . . . well, let's just say he was supposed to be unlikeable, not laughable.

This is an ACTION film, and we're supposed to be entertained by its action-packed images that would have our adrenaline overflowing. Ridley Scott sure knows how to mix action with drama. I was greatly inspired by not only the battle scenes (both in the forest and in the coliseum), but also the visual spectacle that is Rome. Yes, it's CGI, but it looks so beautiful. The acting is also a plus. Crowe, Nielsen, and Phoenix are excellent here, though I was devastated to see that Crowe won the oscar instead of Tom Hanks for Cast Away. But anyway, they're all brilliant I enjyoed watching this film very much. Grade: A",

Everytime that I watch this film I am transported in time. I feel that in the end my breath is taken away. The score is superb and one of the best ever.

The first battle, you couldn't see what was going on in it. Russell Crowe's character was never really challenged throughout the film. I did think Crowe did a good job in the film. It was to expected after standout performances in LA Confidential and The Insider. The story just did not draw me in. Everything looked too easy for Crowe's character (I know I am repeating myself here). It is just disheartening when a good director and a good actor get together and they make a mediocre film. A similar film is Braveheart. Braveheart is a much better film than this. That film thrust you into the battle scenes and made you care about William Wallace. That film had heart, while this film seemed cold and distant. I am sure Scott and Crowe will bounce back with their next projects.",

And now some people are actually hopeful that this movie will get an Oscar for Best Picture. How sickening! But then these are the same people who gave Titanic two dozen Oscars.

Although there are some of those ""I think I'm gonna hurl"" moments, there is a lot more to this movie. Reason #3: Ridley Scott & Co. do a good job of recreating Rome as it might have been back in 180 A.D. This is a movie that, I think, will win these Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor-Russell Crowe, Best Supporting Actor-Joaquin Phoenix, Best Director-Ridley Scott, Best Visual Effects, Best Costume Design, Best Sound, and Best Choreography.

On the whole it's not an emotional film, which I found quite surprising, but if you like action and you're a lover of history (without casting too much of a critical eye on the accuracy of the history), then you'll love it! The special effects are brilliant and the storyline is good for what could potentially be a very boring film in the hands of the wrong director.The only complaint I had having seen the DVD, was that they left out a couple of really good scenes, which would have completed the film quite nicely.",

Without recycling the same ideas already stated some 500 times before me, I'd like to add that what is wonderful about Joaquin Phoenix's performance in particular is that he doesn't simply make his character fall into the typical villain stereotypes, but rather provides his Commodus with a depth and resourcefulness that make him truly understandable. Treacherous and menacing he may be, but the new Emperor is also wounded, emotionally, perhaps more deeply than any other character in the film. His character might have been the focus of a movie which aimed at creating Shakespeareanesque tragedy rather than heroic epic. The plot, of course, demands resolution in traditional style, but Phoenix does not allow the complexity of Commodus' character to be lost. Bravo!",

For means of assuring that you have the remastered version, you're advised to consult the advice from other reviewers--which, unfortunately, continues to be timely.Gladiator (Sapphire Series) [Blu-ray]",
40968,__label__1,"Should be better than it is: I don't think I've written a review on Amazon yet for as much as I've shopped here, but I felt compelled to review this Blu-Ray release. Gladiator is one of my favorite movies and I was quite excited about this release. To much dismay, most of the movie visually feels like I am watching an upscaled DVD. There are some moments that shine, but the difference between the great quality of the extended scenes and the processing that plagues the theatrical scenes are very noticeable that it has really made me question why the whole movie couldn't be transferred with the superb visuals displayed in the extended scenes.Overall, the movie is still great with a nice bundle of extras included, but I am still very disappointed with the video quality of the theatrical footage which is what I was mostly looking forward to with this purchase.",
40969,__label__1,"Disappointing: This is another case of a well prepared advertisement campaign. Weeks before the film entered the cinemas the world was praising the film as something nobody else had ever seen before. Now, there lay exactly the problem. The 1964 version of ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" (with Sophia Loren) tells more or less the same story but without all the sound effects available now. Take those Dolby Suround/THX effects and you will have a very dull story. That's why I insist watching The Fall of the Roman Empire might lack some technical quality but it beats The Gladiator in most parts. If you like battle scenes and man-to-man fights you get the right movie. Anything beyond that is an insult.",

Yeah, Russell Crowe looks great with muscles. Here's a tip for ya...he looked good without 'em, too, AND he seemingly could act better (Recall ""LA Confidential"" if you will, and the incredible performance he turned in for ""The Insider""). He was sleepwalking through this film. The effects were passable...I did like the overview of the Coliseum on the first day of the Games. But beyond that...yawn.The best thing about this film was Joaquin Phoenix, who proves once again, after the dreadful ""8MM"", that he can shine in anything!",

There are plenty of fight scenes, some great mano a mano action and some beautiful shots of Rome that make you wonder if you are in the right movie as the grey scale hits big.The problem with this movie is that the greatly hyped special effects are used way too often. You almost expect Jar Jar to show up. And it seems particularly bloodless when a gladiator is cut in half, more than it would be if they used camera angles and visual trickery. Like other computer generated movies, this one leaves you with a headache at the end. So when Russell Crowe gasps ""your son is safe"", you don't have time to ponder exactly how safe is a kid whose a member of the Roman royal family where the average life span is 8.",

There is no explicit sex (and the only innuendo is shown as desired by one party and rejected by the other, and not accomplished) and only one or two instances of swearing. There are, however, definitely some adult themes of vengeance, incest (desired by the evil emperor, so it's given proper moral context), and gore. Lots of gore. This movie is as gory as you have heard. If that doesn't bother you, however, and great themes of courage, nobility, and justice float your boat, you should purchase this movie.",

He plays every single role the same: the self-proclaimed inner hero, but with a hard outer shell. So now all of a sudden he's this artist? I personally enjoyed the death scene: picking up his head, gasping, then falling down. My ten-year-old sister could do better then that.",

It certainly does not compare favourably to classic Roman epics like Spartacus and Quo Vadis. The acting and the dialogue were mediocre at best. I certainly did not feel any sympathy for Maximus in his time of sorrow. Derek Jacobi's senator was a waste of screen time. Commodus came off as a whiny cowardly brat.The best movie of 2000 was Titus. The acting was first class , the directing superb and the movie had a dialogue from a true master, William Shakespeare.

40982,__label__1,"Halfway there.: I've been a big fan of Crowe since Romper Stomper and thought he was great in LA Confidential, but in Gladiator there's really not much for him to do but grunt. The opening battle scene was a mess and early on set the pattern for all that followed in the arena. Scott seems to have gone for the typical high gloss form of Hollywood filmmaking, employing quick cuts with something flying into the camera every second (the latter seems to be the action norm ever since the Twister trailer). The ending is the very definition of anti-climatic. Bottom line, Gladiator never figured out if it wanted to be Braveheart or 13th Warrior, and as a result ended up stuck somewhere between an epic film and a fun movie. Too bad it couldn't make up its mind. Still, I'm looking forward to the DVD's commentary tracks; if nothing else, at least it looked pretty.",
40983,__label__1,"Don't waste 2 1/2 hours of your life: I didn't find this movie that much of an attention grabber. The storyline was very slow and very long.

One of the only good things that caught my eye, or my ear I should say, was the soundtrack. The composer did an excellent job with the soundtrack.The other thing that caught my eye was some of the special effects.The acting by Joaquin Phoenix was just atrocious. I can't believe they made this guy such a cry baby. His mellowdramatic scenes were some of the worst that I had ever seenI would only recommend this to someone that really likes Russel Crowe.

The story dragged on and on; historical verity was pure Hollywood, so far as I could tell; and nothing seemed so important as pretty scenery and luminous cinematographic effects. Finally, the dialogue was nothing short of embarrassing--towards the end, my friend and I gave up all efforts to conceal our laughter. Neither Crowe's bedrock solidity nor Joaquin Phoenix' Fiennes-like homoerotic flamboyance could save this film (check out the latter's 'busy little bee' tirade).

I couldn't really tell what was going on but it was exciting. Some of the transitions reminded me of a car ad. The dialog was not good.

He plays a character that you just love to hate and he is really good at it too.

I am not exaggerating in the least when I say the video looks like a 480 source scaled to 1080 resolution with overly aggressive sharpening and digital filtering. Edges look enhanced and fine details get blurred over throughout, all of which takes away from the viewing experience. In my opinion, it is marginally better than the Extended Edition DVD scaled on my Toshiba HD-XA2, and nowhere near the quality that the Blu Ray medium is capable of. My recommendation would be to stay away from this release unless you absolutely must watch it in ""high definition"" today.",
41092,__label__2,"Extended what?: This is advertised as an ""extended edition"", but your technical information does not mention the length of this ""extended"" edition as other listings do. Is it an extended edition because it's loaded with extras, like commentaries etc? Or are there deleted scenes included in the movie itself. If you're going to advertise an ""Extended"" edition you should at least explain what the extensions are! I want to buy this movie but not until I see further explanation. I'm sure many of your other customers feel the same way. Your marketing people should be more on the ball. You're losing a lot of sales due to their lack of expertise.",
41093,__label__2,"The best movie EVER: If you liked Braveheart as much as I did, you probably thought that it would never have an equal. But guess what, Gladiator has come out, and although hard to concieve, this movie is every bit as good as Braveheart, but the battle scenes and intensity of the plot are even better. This movie is not for people with a weak tolerance for violence, but if you bring yourself to see it, you will understand, as many others do, why this movie is the most intense film ever!",
41094,__label__2,its one of those movies: this is one of those movies that when it ends you sit there and think about it and how amazingly good it was. most movies you leave the theater with your friends and forget the movie 5 minutes later because there are more important things there like girls and food. anybody who gave this movie under 4 stars was probably sidetracked when they saw it or was some history teacher that cant stand innaccurate movies. and theres always the people that are obsessed with chickens and whatnot who should be ignored anyways. this movie just seems like its on a different level than all the movies being pumped out today for cash.,
41095,__label__2,"One of the best movies I've ever seen: This is one of the best movies out there. It has awesome effects and the gladiator fight scenes are sweet. I know the movie wasn't true and most of it didn't happen in ancient history but that makes it even more exciting. I know that nobody expected the ending but in a few ways it makes the movie better. I think this is one of the coolest movies there is. If you haven't seen it you should rent it. If you like it as much as I do then buy it, you'll want to see it again.",
41096,__label__1,"bad history. bad costumes. just plain bad.: This is one of the worst movies to come out in years. The history is appallingly bad. It's down right offensive to anyone who knows anything at all about the Roman Empire. The costumes (which won an Oscar!) are even worse (note that the emperor's sister is wearing a Victorian corset, complete with busk, over a sari in one scene!). It's criminal that Hollywood gets away with such travesties, and is rewarded with praise and adulation for them, especially when these so called ""historical"" movies end up in our children's classrooms as study aids. Why can't the entertainment industry spend the extra five minutes to check their history, or hire a consultant? The ONLY reason to see this film is if you're a die-hard Russell Crowe fan (and even then in falls into the same group as the quick and the dead: Watch the Russell scenes, and fast forward through the rest).",
41097,__label__1,"A snail is faster: The one star is for Scotts use of that much film without losing his guild card. The pacing of this movie, with the exception of several fight scenes, is leaden. Regardless of what is happening, everyone moves at the same slow pace. Even when the bad guys are hot on the trail, the good guys just sleepwalk through another scene. This might be because this 2.5 hr movie only has 1.25 hrs of plot. Even with all this extra time, nobody thought to add a little dialogue to clean up all the loose ends. For example, after the early battle, he says he wants to go home to his farm & family. If he had said his farm was in Spain (easily done)then it would make sense that he was called the Spaniard when he was a slave. This is just one of many examples of this films many failures.Save your money or buy some porn. The dialogue is almost as good and the acting is better.",
41098,__label__1,"Why did this win best picture?: It is a great action movie. Keyword there is action. Best picture is supposed to be a drama, and Gladiator is far from and excellent drama. In fact all the dramatic scenes were pretty bogus. I cant even believe people voted Gladiator the best-best picture of all time. Gladiator should never have won best picture. If action movies won at the oscars than why hasn't Arnold won an oscar. Arnold's action beats Ridley Scott's any day. Another epic by another Aussie is 6 thousand times better: Braveheart. William Wallace has chunks of guys like Maximus in his stool. Braveheart is far and away a better best picture candidate. In fact every other best picture winner is better than Gladiator, because Gladiator never should have won best picture.",

There are some great actors in Gladiator. . .but what a waste of talent. The plot is so hackneyed and Hollywood, and call me female, but I don't find prisoners being hacked to bits entertaining. He's forced to be a Gladiator, so he decides to be the best darn gladiator there ever was. . .Yeah! Doesn't that fill your heart with a warm, rosy glow?? UH, NO!! And the emperor getting down there to fight with him. . .that was the last straw. . .even Caligula would've called that crazy.

41102,__label__1,"Every accent except Roman: I got a laugh watching this movie times simply because the actors didn't even attempt to hide their true accents or try sounding Roman. And if you watch the fight scene that includes Tigers, you can see the Tigers lying down (and sleeping) in the background. I doubt that this was intentional humor.Overall, the movie was kind of a blur for the action scenes then slow and plodding during the drama. I predicted the final outcome 20 mins into the movie and was sadly correct. The script just didn't have any life to it.On the positive side, Russell Crowe has a great voice and the non-incestuous sister was very attractive. Although the computer animation was obvious, it was impressive to see Rome in all it's glory.Rent before you buy may be my best advice on this one.",

41105,__label__1,"to gag is not enough: Actually, I would like to give this movie a negative star rating. Ridley Scott basically raped the Roman Empire and put a modern socio-political spin on a time when there weren't even free elections. Seeing Maximus throw down his sword and shout, ""Are you not entertained?"" at spectators of a gladiator fight had me screaming, ""Die next time!"" Of course, Maximus had to be the adult, white male, accepting of all other colors, creeds, and genders (and he loves those innocent little kids). Good stuff, for today to be sure, but that's what makes this movie fiction and not historical fiction. It's odd that this happy, feel good concept is juxtaposed to a dark, gloomy back drop and morose faces on characters. Scott was clearly trying really hard to say something, maybe even something important, which makes this bad movie all the more embarassing.",
41106,__label__1,"Best Picture? Give me a break.: I thoroughly HATED this movie. The fight scene with the tigers was visually spectacular, but that doesn't make up for a drudgingly dull plot & awful acting from Russell Crowe. He Is, in my opinion, the single most over-rated actor in the last 20 years. He has gone above and beyond when it comes to OVER ACTING, none of his roles that I've seen have been convincing OR entertaining. I am certainly not qualified to critisize an actor and nobody may find my review to be helpful, but I have to be honest in my opinions and mine is this: THIS MOVIE IS A STINKER!",
41107,__label__2,"At my mark, unleash Hell: The movie is pure entertainment with strong actors, mesmerizing music, and stunning special effects. There is no weak part of this movie. The ending is very moving and makes you realize that while seeing this film, you would eagerly follow Russell Crowe, as Maximus, through Hell to get to the Elysian fields. Maximus is a man among men in this Blockbuster epic that is the best movie since Ben Hur. A very stong candidate come Oscar Award time.",

No need to 2x4 me over the head.On the good side, the cinemaphotography is breathtaking. Really lovely shots that I kept imagining framed and on my wall. Acting is well done and Gravitas (Oliver Reed) was splendid. He will be much missed.I was told that this was a very gorey film. I did not come away with that impression at all. I would watch it again.",
41109,__label__2,"Pretty good: When I watched this movie, I thought it was going to be a mindless action romp. I was proved wrong. Despite the graphic violence (I had to close my eyes on some parts), it was definitely an amazing movie. It was so beautifully filmed and acted. The characters seemed slightly odd to our standards. That just gave the feel that this really was more than one thousand years ago and almost a completely different world. Even though the fighting was gory, it was always well choreographed. Russel Crowe did a fabulous job as a brave and honorable fighter (he's awesome!), as did everyone. I definitely suggest this movie, despite the bloodiness (if that's a word). I know I haven't told much about the plot, but there really isn't a very complicated one.",
41110,__label__2,"Good story: Good story. I admire the way the ending was handled. It could have ruined the entire film for me, but instead it was beautifully portrayed. I was awed by Crowe's character's fighting skills. I especially liked that last fight. I'm a big fan of action and horror flicks but I found the violence in this film to be especially graphic. Some may find that realism to be a plus. Parents might not want their younger kids to see this film. I must say that the costumes and the scenery in this film were a definite plus. They did a very good job of recreating the Colliseum. It all looked so real.",

Why would a parent be encouraging their children anyways? Nita acts childish and her relationship with her sister is plain stupid. They never fight and are always helpful to eachother.

The magic in them is much more complex than it is in the Harry Potter books. It's not just a wave of your wand and some Latin words; it's geometric shapes and strange words in Speech (the wizarding language) written in the sand, wizard's knots and paragraphs to say in Speech. I also like the idea of a manual that teaches Nita and Kit (the main characters) wizardry, instead of a teacher. The characters also seem more real than they do in some other fantasy books (at least the human ones do). This is a great series!",

I thought that the creativity of the creatures and entropy were so clever, with all of the carnivorous cars and the dragon in the subway. The setting on New York City really put and interesting twist on the plot that left me thinking, maybe in all of those deep dark places, maybe there really are dragons and wizards saving the planet and the universe every day. I read a lot of fantasy books and this book along with all of the other three in the wizardry series are definitely going on my favorites list.

The book is nice in and on itself, but this time the suggested age (9-12) actually fits!

His mind was mercurial, and often changed by the last person with whom he spoke, but the final decision, good or bad, was always his. This is an extremely readable work that takes us through the last years of his life, when life around him became extremely bad, not only because of his natural inclination to incite terror, but the very real physical pain he sufered from various problems with his often abused body.

While ""the only true ideas are those of the shipwrecked,"" it often takes Mankind too much time to unite for the common good, the author suggests, making obvious parallels to the Nazi experience that befell Europe only a few years prior to publication of this novel.Camus weaves his magic subtly, methodically thrusting the reader into a vortex of dark passion, on the premise that discomfort at best, or pure adversity at worst, may be a necessary tonic against complacency.

Also, unlike the other past Fifa titles, I spent at least 80 to 90% of my time playing defense and it's almost impossible to get the ball down to the oppenents goal to score because they always seem to strip the ball away from you. I also own the Winning Eleven 9 soccer series. Although it's more expensive that Fifa 2006, I would highly recommend it over this year's Fifa game.

The author wrote this in 1941 to celebrate the survival of Africanness in African-American culture. It was a pioneering work by someone who was not himself an African-American and subsequent scholars, particularly those from the African-American community, have gone far beyond it.

The suggestion that psychopaths should be allowed to exercise their free will to wreak havoc on society is so transparently idiotic nobody can take it seriously. Combined with the terrible acting, cheap sets, and relentless vulgarity and misogyny, the result is about as ugly as moviemaking gets.",

Without exception, all Alex's victims are more 'obnoxious' than they are in the novel, as if Kubrick was attempting to 'justify' their treatment at his hands. This attitude is completely inexcusable. It is no wonder that Burgess was very unhappy with the film and chose to distance himself from it: a book about the importance of free-will had been altered beyond recognition into nothing more than a vindication of its main character.Reading the previous reviews, I am troubled by how this film is almost universally regarded as the epitome of ""cool."".END",

So please ignore the comment on here complaining that it is letterbox. I believe Clockwork is in a slightly wider format that 3:4, although it is possible that it also (like full metal jacket, the shining, eyes wide shut, etc) was supposed to be 3:4 and has been here restored.

It hardly shows the importance of the invention of printing in the spreading of Luther's movement.What is the importance of having a Bible written in German? I missed this and many other topics in the film. It is not a matter of telling facts, it's a matter of introducing people into the mind of a man and the period where he lived.

This is a great historical drama and should be of interest to those who are not particularly religious. From what I can gather, its is quite accurate historically.

It's not in any way that kind of movie. Rather, it's a devotional treatment, appropriate for a Protestant religious family looking for a wholesome movie for a holiday. The opening scenes show young Luther to be so pious and important that even straightening his shirt is accompanied by pious grimaces and an entire string section. Every word out of Fiennes' mouth is delivered more hammy than a Hamlet monologue. The movie settles down into a predictable heroism (nothing extraneous to his religious bravery gets a line): all the Catholic Church is full of corrupt meanies who know they're corrupt, and every peasant cheers Luther on. It's a nicely staged Bible type movie, full of all the usual cliches, but it's about as interested in a nuance as Luther was interested in an indulgence.",

The most I expect is relative historical accuracy, while capturing the significant character, objective character, of an individual's life.This was a lovely film presentation of good acting, music, photography, drama, heroic characters from history, at various points in the life of an important historical figure, during a dramatic, important time in history.

It even portrays some of Luther's very personal battles with Satan, which surprised me. But the movie suffers where most religious films suffer, it only gives a superficial treatment of Luther's beliefs. The movie is historical moments which hint at the underlying theology only. Having been so bold as to depict Luther striving against the devil during his early years and during his trial at Worms, the film leaves out his greatest fight with the prince of darkness which came as he was translating the Bible into common German. This is the famous fight that ended with Luther throwing an inkwell across the room into the apparition of Satan to dispel it. This omission of Luther's most overt battle with evil and the glossing over of Luther's ideas render this otherwise excellent film a less than perfect, four star effort. Still worth seeing though.",

It is reasonably accurate, but like any video, it cannot portray all that a person is. It does not include Luther's changes in his later life where he (as did the Roman Church) elevate the clergy to be special keepers of the faith. Nonetheless, what is portrayed is powerfull and certainly one gets the price paid for listening to and obeying God while trying to work within the instutition of the earthy ""church."" It is very much like that today in many American churches, where the gospel has become distorted by both the fundamentalists and liberals of modernity and those who have abandoned objective truth all together in postmodernity. It brought this reader to a new sense of great humility for the blessings and freedoms that we do injoy in the western world and the incredible strength from God as we experience him and live in that relationship.",

It's obvious that they arent together on this record, it doesent sound anything like the old KISS. Don't get me wrong KISS is one of a kind but even they admitted it's over musically.

For the first time in 20 years or so, both Ace Frehley and Peter Criss were back in the lineup. Kiss was back in makeup, and with the lineup restored, things seemed ripe for a great reunion album. Unfortunately, most of the songs come across as slightly weak, and while there are classics throughout, this is no debut album, Hotter than Hell, or Destroyer revisited. My personal favorite on the album is Into the Void, Ace's major contribution to the album. All in all, it beats a lot of the 'unmasked' period works, but only those who really want everything the original lineup made need apply. (The most unfortunate part of the album is that, for the subsequent tour, Peter Criss was again kicked out of the lineup, replaced with former bandmate Eric Singer, who wore Peter's Catman makeup.)",

Paul wrote a song for Peter ""I finally found my way"" which I am sorry to say is a weak followup to 'Beth', however, it does have some emotional overtones which were unexpected. Ace recorded better songs than 'Into the Void' on his solo albums. ""You wanted the best"" is about as hokey as it gets. However,with these few exceptions, Psycho Circus is a great CD which I am sure that this will develop into yet another incredible tour.

Aside from the horrible ""You Wanted the Best"" song, I listen to this all the way through and enjoy it very much. There is a great European 2 disc set that is worth finding since it has 6 live tracks on the second disk. You might also want to find ""In Your Face"", which is a bonus song on the Japanese disk.

Naturally, the Florence in the time of the Renaissance is covered at length, but Levey doesn't stop there. He gives lots of insight into the patronage of art in succeeding periods.

His understanding of Florentine history is poor and often down right insulting (his remarks that the vibrant political life in the early communal period was like the ""mafia"" is a fine example). His insistence on the greatness of Sienese art and on Northern Renaissance Art are wholly inappropriate in a book on Florence. It would be like writing a book on the history of the British Empire and constantly making a point to discuss imperial Russia or Rome. Let's focus on the topic at hand and save the other comments for other books. Mr Levey announces his lack of ability as a historian at the beginning of the work and he is certainly accurate.

I mean, surely the people who are capable of both earning and saving $10million dollars don't need a book, and the rest of us... well, does being told, ""your life will end terribly if you don't put aside at least $3million"" really help us to achieve that goal?",

It neither does a good job of telling readers how to do determine or reach ""the number"", nor does it help much with the bigger point, i.e. that retirement is more than money.

41996,__label__1,"Bad sound - no bass: The sound quality is so bad...especially when volume level is increased...no equalizer options so can't adjust the bass, treble etc.,No holes to hang somewhere....poor design so it just rolls out if I try to place in a table....And it looks like eyes of some alien from mars....so bright blue light, disturbing eyes at night...pluses are quick delivery and cheap cost....I am using it to hear audio books...(and for music I bought an some other product).....Best option is to put some +20$ and go for some popular + good speakers available in the market...If you want to hear good music with decent bass + treble + balance...it is not worth...",
41997,__label__2,portable speaker system: I like to take this and my mp3 out to the pool at night. Works great and easy to carry and set up. Plenty loud anywhere in the pool except underwater. Nice product.,
41998,__label__2,"Perfect for my needs: I was looking for something cheap to take to the beach and attach to my MP3 player. This fit the bill ($20), was light, and the volume went high enough without too much distortion. Just be realistic with your expectations...",
41999,__label__2,"Great value, great sound for the price: You cant beat these speakers for the $20 price tag. Good sound, any little bit of distortion can be eliminated by adjusting the Eq on your mp3 player, along with the volumes on speaker and your mp3 unit. I have to agree with everyone else about the lack of a sturdy stand. I found that if you use the case and fold over one side and rest the speaker on the case you can adjust the direction of sound a bit better. It also seems to make the speakers sound a bit better (that part might be my imagination lol )",
