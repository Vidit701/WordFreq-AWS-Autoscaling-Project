8416,229931,BJRI,These 5 Stocks Sport Impressive Interest Coverage Ratio,opinion,We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers  These  however  may not be enough  Sometimes  a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter  This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on  But if you seek long term returns  investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results A critical analysis of a company s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision  Here  coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role  The higher the ratio  the better it is  The focus of this article is on  Interest Coverage   which is one such ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment VGM Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are five of

BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI    CBRE Group  Inc    NYSE CBRE    Dave   Buster s Entertainment  Inc    NASDAQ PLAY    Lithia Motors  Inc    NYSE LAD   and The Boeing Company   NYSE BA   Scoop Up These 5 Stocks with Amazing Interest Coverage RatiosA layman can end up losing bucks if he decides to pick a stock only on the basis of numbers flashing on a real time stock screen  A critical analysis of a company s financial background is essential for a better investment decision Often investors evaluate a company s performance by simply looking at its sales and earnings  which sometimes do not reveal the real picture  To be more precise  they do not tell whether a company s fundamentals are sound enough to meet its financial obligations  Here  the role of coverage ratios comes into play   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is crucial to financing operations for the majority of companies  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company  And the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Interest Coverage Ratio suggests how many times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm has for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than one suggests that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  One should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time For the rest of this Screen of the Week article please visit Zacks com at

Darden s acquisition of the small restaurant chain  Cheddar s Scratch Kitchen  Cheddar s   in April 2017 has added an undisputed casual dining value to the company s portfolio of differentiated brands  It also helped Darden to expand its scale further  In the first quarter of fiscal 2019  Cheddar s total sales grew 6 5  driven by organic new restaurant growth and franchise restaurant acquisition growth of 10 5  
In order to boost the performance of the Olive Garden brand  the company implemented a set of initiatives under its Brand Renaissance Plan  These initiatives included simplifying kitchen systems  improving sales planning and scheduling as well as operational excellence to enhance guest experience  developing new core menu items  allowing customization  and making smarter promotional investments 
Supported by these initiatives  Olive Garden posted the 16th consecutive quarter of positive comps in first quarter fiscal 2019  Meanwhile  Darden is focusing on technology driven initiatives like the system wide rollout of tablets in order to capitalize on the digital wave that has hit the U S  fast casual restaurant sector  This initiative has already boosted sales over the past few quarters 

 
At LongHorn  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company strives to attract its guests by focusing on core menu  culinary innovation and providing regional flavors  Darden is also working on its marketing strategy to improve execution  customer relationship management and digital advertising as well as build a strong promotional pipeline that leverage the segment s expertise 
Meanwhile  the company continues to focus on strengthening its in restaurant execution through strategic investments in quality and simplification of operations in order to augment the guest experience  Backed by these strategic efforts  segmental comps have registered growth for 22 consecutive quarters 
Concerns
Increased wages and costs incurred due to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act resulted in higher labor costs  This  in turn  is expected to persistently keep profits under pressure  The company s non franchised model also makes it susceptible to increased expenses 
Since all the restaurants are owned and operated by Darden  instead of signing franchise agreements and putting the burden of costs into the franchisee  the company is solely responsible for the expenses of operating the business 
Total operating costs and expenses increased 6 3  year over year to  1 9 billion  This uptick can be attributed to an overall increase in food and beverage costs  restaurant labor and expenses  and marketing costs  Consequently  operating margin in the reported quarter contracted 20 basis points  bps  on a year over year basis

8438,229953,RS,Is Reliance Steel A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co    NYSE RS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Reliance Steel has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 11  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 19 89  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts Reliance Steel s current PE ratio below its midpoint over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 15 59  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Reliance Steel has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 93  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Reliance Steel stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Reliance Steel has a P S ratio of about 0 57  This is significantly lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 12 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Reliance Steel currently has a Value Style Score of  B   putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Reliance Steel a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for Reliance Steel is just 1 55  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 61  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate What About the Stock Overall Though Reliance Steel might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  F  and a Momentum score of  F   This gives RS a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  D    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been unfavorable  The current quarter has seen four estimates go lower in the past sixty days  while the full year estimate has seen seven down in the same time period This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has dropped by 8 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has dropped by 3 6   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co  Price and Consensus      Despite the bearish analyst sentiments  the stock holds a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Thus  we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near termBottom LineReliance Steel is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Furthermore  a top industry rank  among Top 10  of more than 250 industries  instills our confidence on the stock On the flipside  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye On Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market s record highs  but picking the best ones to buy can be tough  There s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector  Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without  More importantly  it reveals 4 top stocks set to skyrocket on increasing demand for these devices  I encourage you to get the report now   before the next wave of innovations really take off ,2017-08-24,Zacks Investment

8450,229965,BJRI,5 Stocks That Sport Remarkable Interest Coverage Ratio,opinion,You can simply arrive at a decision to Buy or Sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers  But such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns  A critical analysis of the company s financial background is always required for a better investment decision  A company s fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations  This can be judged with coverage ratios   the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations  Here we

Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company s creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time What s the Strategy Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a

8453,229968,RS,Trump s Steel Import Probe  U S  Steel Over Reliance ,opinion,"Domestic steel maker United States Steel and its foreign rival Reliance Steel are scheduled to report first quarter earnings next week  Both companies are expected to come up with stellar performances  Which of these will come out ahead  Such a comparison comes into sharp focus considering Trump s latest policy imperative  steel imports 
Trump Probe Bolster Steel Stocks
After being stuck in a long rut  steel stocks rebounded yesterday  The industry s rebound was backed by President Trump s announcement of an investigation into whether cheap steel imports from China and other nations are hurting our national security  President Trump said yesterday that  steel is critical to both our economy and our military  and it is a  historic day for American steel   Following this statement shares of United States Steel   NYSE X    AK Steel Holding Corporation   NYSE AKS   and Steel Dynamics  Inc    NASDAQ STLD   increased 7 4   8 6  and 6 8   respectively 
U S  Steel had acknowledged earlier that it entered 2017 with improved market conditions than what it had faced at the onset of 2016  The company said that it expects net earnings of around  3 08 per share for 2017 should market conditions remain robust  This came as a breather for the company s analysts after it incurred an adjusted loss of  1 60 per share last year 
Reliance Steel   Aluminum   NYSE RS    in its fourth quarter of 2016  projected demand to be up by 8  to 10  on a sequential basis in the first quarter of 2017  Moreover  the company had forecast average selling price to increase 2  to 4  from the fourth quarter of 2016 
Price Performance
Shares of both United States Steel and Reliance Steel notched up gains in the last year but U S  Steel is a clear winner on this count with a return of more than 55 9  in the last twelve months  In contrast  Reliance Steel increased only 7   falling behind the S P 500 which rallied around 11 6  during the same period 

Valuation
Though United States Steel and Reliance Steel belong to different Zacks categorized industries  the average trailing 12 month EV EBITDA ratio is one of the best valuation multiples for the steel sector  This is mainly because steel companies have a large amount of debt and EV  Enterprise Value  

Coming to EV EBITDA  United States Steel is the one which lags behind with a ratio of 12 12 compared with 7 18 for the  industry  On the other hand  Reliance Steel has an EV EBITDA ratio of 9 74  which is in line with the  industry  

Dividend Yield

In the last year  the dividend yield for Reliance Steel was higher than the broader industry  While the Metal Producer Distributor industry offered a yield of 1 15   Reliance Steel returned 2 34   U S  Steel falls marginally short on this count  providing a dividend yield of 0 66  compared to the industry average of 1 12  

Earnings History and ESP
Riding on higher revenues  Reliance Steel posted profits of  61 7 million or 84 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2016  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents  Additionally  its revenues rose around 1 7  year over year to  2 06 billion in the reported quarter  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 03 billion   Read more   
In contrast  U S  Steel recorded net loss of  105 million or 61 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2016  The results included unfavorable adjustments of  152 million  However  barring one time items  earnings were 27 cents per share that outstripped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a penny per share  Moreover  revenues of  2 650 million trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 666 million  but increased 3  year over year   Read more   
Considering a detailed earnings history  Reliance Steel delivered positive surprises in three of the prior four quarters  with an average earnings surprise of 7 1   In comparison  United States Steel delivered an earnings beat in only two of the trailing four quarters  but posted an average positive earnings surprise of more than 630   When considering   Reliance Steel s ESP is at 4 32   while United States Steel s ESP stands at 14 71  
Conclusion
Our comparative analysis shows that Reliance Steel holds an edge over United States Steel only when considering dividend yield and valuation  However  U S  Steel registered a better price performance  has a better Earnings ESP and delivered a significantly higher average positive earnings surprise  Also  on the rank front  U S  Steel sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   while Reliance Steel carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

8455,229970,RS,Nucor  The Best Shining U S  Steel Stock,opinion,"Recent History of Steel Stocks
The U S  steel industry has been in a downtrend since the 2008 global recession due  in large part  to China s dumping of cheap steal into the market  The chart below illustrates just how much the imbalance of China s imports and exports of steel has widened since 2009 
Source  This supply and demand imbalance has pushed steel prices lower which has weighed heavily on producers such as United States Steel Corporation  NYSE X   Nucor Corporation  NYSE NUE  and Steel Dynamics Inc  NASDAQ STLD   However  sentiment for this sluggish industry changed following the election of President Donald Trump and his  America First  focus 
What Makes Steel Stocks Shine Now 
Just last month  President Trump ordered a   The potential outcomes of this Section 232 investigation could be additional tariffs and or  limiting imports of foreign made steel  This could help inflate U S  steel prices which would ultimately help U S  steel manufactures 
Global demand also appears to be on the uptrend  The  reported in April that the global steel capacity utilization is up by 26   its highest level in nearly two and half years 
More recently on May 24th   Credit Suisse   the entire steel sector highlighting that its  channel checks with U S  traders and OEMs indicate that a structural change is taking place with respect to U S  trade  which the market is underestimating  
Tailwinds appear to be building in the U S  steel market 
Why Nucor 
Nucor Corporation is an American steel and related products producer  It is the largest steel producer in the U S  and also the largest minimill steelmaker  The use of minimills in steel manufacturing rather than traditional methods of melting the scrap steel adds more value to Nucor when compared with traditional manufacturers such as U S  Steel Corp and AK Steel Holding Corporation  NYSE AKS  
Minimills are already experiencing a comeback and have been a bright spot in the industry  Bradford Research  that profits for minimills are up 50  to 100  compared to this time a year ago 
In addition  Nucor is a well diversified and well positioned U S  steel company  Over the last several years  the company focused on expanding its business in new areas such as Canada and Mexico to help combat geographic specific downturns  These precautious actions should pave the way for tremendous growth going forward in addition to any potential comeback in the U S  steel market 
The company s 2016 EBITDA and EBITDA margin of  2 116 and 13 1   respectively  reached a level not seen since 2008  Furthermore  the company s unique  helped Nucor stay profitable though the steel industry s downturn as shown below 
Nucor s profit and returns are also well above its industry peers and the materials sector as a whole as illustrated below 
Peers include  X  Commercial Metals Company  NYSE CMC   AKS  Worthington Industries Inc  NYSE WOR   Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co  NYSE RS   Ampco Pittsburgh Corporation  NYSE AP  and Handy   Harman Ltd  NASDAQ HNH   
Nucor s Quality Margin of Safety
Nucor shares also look attractive on a fundamental cash flow basis  When applying Wall Street projections to eleven separate valuation analyses  finbox io calculates an intrinsic value estimate of  62 75 that implies 8  upside 
Nucor is a diversified  high quality business with a consistent track record and looks to be trading at a discount  A potential increase in global demand coupled with President Trump s trillion dollar investment plan and section 232 investigation provide additional upside for Nucor shareholders

8456,229971,RS,Should Value Investors Consider Reliance Steel   Aluminum  RS  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co    NYSE RS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Reliance Steel   Aluminum has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14 64  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 19  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Reliance Steel   Aluminum s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years However  the stock s PE also compares unfavorably with the Zacks classified Metal Products   Distribution industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 12 39  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that Reliance Steel   Aluminum has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 34  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Reliance Steel   Aluminum stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Reliance Steel   Aluminum has a P S ratio of about 0 60  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 12 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Reliance Steel   Aluminum currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Reliance Steel   Aluminum a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too   For example  the PEG ratio for Reliance Steel   Aluminum is just 1 48  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1 67  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  RS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Reliance Steel   Aluminum might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  B  and a Momentum score of  D   This gives RS a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower  while the full year estimate has seen five up and one down in the same time period This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 2 6  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co  Price and Consensus    Despite this somewhat positive trend the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineReliance Steel   Aluminum is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a strong industry rank  Top 42  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock  However  with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about this company overall  In fact  over the past two year  the Zacks Metal Products   Distribution industry has underperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for broader factors to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More

8458,229973,RS,Reliance Steel   Aluminum Stock Shares Fall as Company Cuts ,opinion,"Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co  
Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co  NYSE RS   metals service center company yesterday announced that they be cutting their second quarter 2017 guidance numbers 
Reliance now expects their second quarter diluted earnings to be in between  1 30 to  1 40 per share which is down from previous guidance numbers of  1 50 to  1 60 per share 
Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co  Comments
 As a result of challenging market conditions  the positive momentum experienced for both demand and pricing trends in the first quarter of 2017 did not accelerate as originally anticipated into the second quarter of 2017  In addition  increased uncertainty in regard to metals pricing has placed downward pressure on the Company s gross profit margin  Despite these changes in market conditions  Reliance continues to believe that it can sustain a reported LIFO gross profit margin within the range of 27  to 29    
RS Technical Analysis


RS opened trading yesterday at  72 99 which was up from the previous day s trading close of  72 44  RS closed trading yesterday at  72 51 and crashed down after market to  67 70  equivalent to a 7  decrease from the closing price 
Taking a look at the daily chart we can see the last time RS traded below these levels we have to go back to November 4th  2016 when it traded at  67 03  Taking a closer look at the daily chart we can see that before the spike down RS had already been in an overall downward trend dating back to March 1st when it traded at  86 27  RS has a  of 70 41 million shares and traded below the normal daily trading volume on Monday 
For trading purposes  I would like to see RS open trading on Tuesday below  69 30 and if it does I would be looking to take a short position at the bell  My  would be  0 30 from my entry position fearing anything more than that and the stock would start to fill in the gap down

Factors to Consider
Reliance Steel  last month  provided its updated earnings outlook for the second quarter  The company anticipates earnings per share in the range of  1 30  1 40 for the second quarter of 2017 compared with the previous outlook of  1 50  1 60 per share Reliance Steel announced that the favorable momentum it witnessed with respect to demand and price in the first quarter of 2017 will not accelerate into the second quarter as it had expected earlier owing to challenging market conditions  The company s gross profit margin also witnessed a downward pressure due to increased uncertainty in metals pricing   Reliance Steel remains optimistic regarding market demand and lower imports  The company is expected to gain from strong momentum across automotive and aerospace markets  It is also likely to benefit from its aggressive acquisition strategy  broad and diversified product base and wide geographic footprint  The company also remain focused on boosting gross profit margin and maximizing market opportunities to drive earnings while managing operating expenses and inventory levels  However  the company s business in the energy markets is expected to remain under pressure due to depressed oil pricing  The non residential construction market  Reliance Steel s biggest end market  also remains on a slow road to recovery  Reliance Steel s shares have lost 5 2  in the last three months  underperforming the  s decline of 2 4    Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Reliance Steel is likely to beat estimates this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here  as you will see below  Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for Reliance Steel is currently  0 73   This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at  1 37 per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  1 38 per share  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Zacks Rank  Although Reliance Steel s Zacks Rank  3 increases the predictive power of ESP  its negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult   Note that Sell rated stocks   4 or 5  should never be considered going into an earnings announcement  especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions  Stocks to Consider Here are some other companies in the industrial space you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter  AGCO Corporation   NYSE AGCO   has an Earnings ESP of  2 88  and a Zacks Rank  1 You can see  AptarGroup  Inc    NYSE ATR   has an Earnings ESP of  1 03  and a Zacks Rank  2  Caterpillar  Inc    NYSE CAT   has an Earnings ESP of  2 38  and a Zacks Rank  2  More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone  It could become the mother of all technological revolutions  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years  creating a  1 7 trillion market  Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it  If you don t buy now  you may kick yourself in 2020 ",2017-07-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/reliance-steel-(rs)-to-post-q2-earnings:-what's-in-store-200203024,200203024

NYSE UNH   and O Reilly Automotive  Inc    NASDAQ ORLY   Screen of the Week of Zacks Investment Research 5 Stocks that Stand Out on Attractive Interest Coverage RatiosWe often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers  These  however  may not be enough  Sometimes  a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter  This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on  But if you seek long term returns  investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results A critical analysis of a company s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision  Here  coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role  The higher the ratio  the better it is  The focus of this article is on  Interest Coverage   which is one such ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time And that

8478,229993,RS,Should Value Investors Pick Reliance Steel   Aluminum Stock ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co    NYSE RS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Reliance Steel   Aluminum has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 01  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 22 48  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Reliance Steel   Aluminum s current PE level puts it above its midpoint of 15 03 over the past five years  with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months Nonetheless  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Industrial Products sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 25 55  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers  We should also point out that Reliance Steel   Aluminum has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 13 94  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Reliance Steel   Aluminum stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Reliance Steel   Aluminum has a P S ratio of about 0 71  This is much lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 56 right now  This makes the stock undervalued from the P S aspect too Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Reliance Steel   Aluminum currently has a Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Reliance Steel   Aluminum a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  for Reliance Steel   Aluminum is 12 00  a level that is lower than the industry average of 15 89  Clearly  RS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though Reliance Steel   Aluminum might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of A  This gives RS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been quite encouraging  The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no downward revisions  while the full year estimate has seen three upward and one downward revision in the same time period This has had a meaningful impact on the consensus estimate  as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 3 1  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has inched higher by 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below However  this bullish trend has likely not yet been reflected in the stock  as we have just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance in the near term  Nonetheless  the bullish analyst sentiment indicates that the stock s prospects in the near term look good Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co  Price and Consensus    Bottom LineReliance Steel   Aluminum is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite a Zacks Rank  3  the stock enjoys an impressive Zacks Industry Rank  among top 2  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  3  which hints at favorable broader factors  In fact  over the past year  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below So  it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company s prospects  as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ,2018-01-22,Zacks Investment

8479,229994,RS,Is Reliance Steel   Aluminum  RS  Stock A Great Combo Of Value And Growth ,opinion,Value investing is always a very popular strategy  and for good reason  After all  who doesn t want to find stocks that have low PEs  solid outlooks  and decent dividends Fortunately for investors looking for this combination  we have identified a strong candidate which may be an impressive value  Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co    NYSE RS   Reliance Steel   Aluminum in FocusRS may be an interesting play thanks to its forward PE of 16 07  its P S ratio of 0 6  and its decent dividend yield of 2 18   These factors suggest that Reliance Steel   Aluminum is a pretty good value pick  as investors have to pay a relatively low level for each dollar of earnings  and that RS has decent revenue metrics to back up its earnings RELIANCE STEEL PE Ratio  TTM    But before you think that Reliance Steel   Aluminum is just a pure value play  it is important to note that it has been seeing solid activity on the earnings estimate front as well  For current year earnings  the consensus has gone up by 1 6  in the past 30 days  thanks to 3 upward revisions in the past one month compared to none lower This estimate strength is actually enough to push RS to a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   suggesting it is poised to outperform  So really  Reliance Steel   Aluminum is looking great from a number of angles thanks to its PE below 20  a P S ratio below one  and a strong Zacks Rank  meaning that this company could be a great choice for value investors at this time ,2016-07-01,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-reliance-steel---aluminum-(rs)-stock-a-great-combo-of-value-and-growth-200139590,200139590
8480,229995,RS,5 Best Bets For The Q2 Earnings Season ,opinion,Now that the focus has shifted from the surprise outcome of the British referendum  market direction is likely to be guided by the Q2 results  The formal commencement of the earnings season is about a week away  but major companies that have already reported are revealing a trend that has a lot in common with the last five quarters However  there are some factors working in favor of results this time around  Commodity prices have recovered substantially and forex woes have also receded to a large extent  This is why it makes good sense to pick stocks that are likely to report strong Q2 results and also have strong fundamentals to back them Energy  Finance  Tech Likely to DisappointOil prices have posted quarterly gains due to a weaker dollar  fall in the U S rig count  rise in gasoline consumption and worldwide outages  However  results from energy companies are likely to be the most disappointing and will weigh on Q2 earnings as a whole  According to Zacks estimates  total earnings for the sector s S P 500 stocks will fall by 78 9  on a 27 1  decline in revenues The other major sectors  which will act as a drag on Q2 earnings  are finance and technology  Q2 earnings for the finance sector s S P 500 stocks are projected to fall by 5 8  on a 0 3  decline in revenues  A soft interest rate environment and sliding benchmark treasury yields are the primary reasons for the sector s woes In technology s case  Apple s  AAPL  earnings alone will weigh on other stocks from the sector  A 28 4  fall in earnings is expected for the iPhone maker on a 15 2  decline in revenues year on year  This will send the sector s earnings 4 5  lower despite a 0 4  increase in revenues  Why Q2 Could be BetterSecond quarter earnings will begin in earnest with Alcoa  NYSE AA  reporting on Jul 11  Some S P 500 companies that have already released results offer a mixed picture  However  a fair conclusion can only be drawn after more companies report earnings  As of now  Zacks estimates for S P 500 companies indicate that earnings will decline by 6 2  on a 0 7  decline in revenues Despite the fact that this could be the fifth successive decline in earnings  an improvement in the current trend could still emerge  This is because of the significant recovery in commodity prices  Additionally  the dollar had declined

Factors to Influence Q2 Results
Interpublic derives a major portion of its revenues from outside the U S  This exposes the company to foreign currency translation impacts  A stronger dollar can have an adverse impact on second quarter revenues  In addition  the company faces other risks like local legislation  monetary devaluation  exchange control restrictions and unstable political conditions  which may hamper revenue growth in the to be reported quarter 
Uncertainties regarding Brexit affected the markets through the latter half of the second quarter of 2016  leading to the referendum in late June  These macroeconomic risks make companies cautious about advertising and marketing outlay  thereby squeezing advertising budgets  This might prove to be a strain on Interpublic s upcoming quarterly results  Also  advertising companies are currently under pressure as major advertising spenders are reviewing their agency accounts 
However  Interpublic s digital capabilities  diversified business model and geographic reach offer a distinctive competitive advantage to its clients  The company is expected to achieve targeted levels in the coming quarters based on diversification across emerging regions and collaboration integration across agencies through technological improvement  Moreover  the company continues to look for strategic investments acquisitions to expand in high growth regions and key world markets For 2016  the company has a cautious stance and expects organic revenue growth of 3 4   with 50 basis points of operating margin improvement over the previous year

8485,230000,BJRI,5 Stocks That Stand Out On Attractive Interest Coverage Ratio,opinion,We often judge a company on the basis of its sales and earnings numbers  These  however  may not be enough  Sometimes  a stock gets a boost if these numbers climb year over year or surpass estimates in a particular quarter  This will definitely be a great opportunity for an investor with a shorter horizon to cash in on  But if you seek long term returns  investments backed only by sales and earnings numbers may not yield the desired results A critical analysis of a company s financial background is a prerequisite for an informed investment decision  Here  coverage ratios that determine whether a company is sound enough to meet its financial obligations play a crucial role  The higher the ratio  the better it is  The focus of this article is on  Interest Coverage   which is one such ratio Interest Coverage Ratio   Earnings before Interest   Taxes  EBIT  divided by Interest Expense Why Interest Coverage Ratio Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt Debt  which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations  comes at a cost called interest  Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and its creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets interest obligations  Therefore  Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest An interest coverage ratio lower than 1 0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt  A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardships  Definitely  one should also track the company s past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time The Winning StrategyApart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average  adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results Interest Coverage Ratio greater than X Industry MedianPrice greater than or equal to 5  The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of  5 or higher 5 Year Historical EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  Stocks that have a strong EPS growth history Projected EPS Growth     greater than X Industry Median  This is the projected EPS growth over the next three to five years  This shows that the stock has near term earnings growth potential Average 20 Day Volume greater than 100 000  A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment VGM Score of less than or equal to B  Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1 or 2 offer the best upside potential  Here are five of the 23 stocks that qualified the screening BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI    which owns and operates casual dining restaurants  has a VGM Score of A and an expected EPS growth rate of 15 3  for 3 5 years  The stock carries a Zacks Rank  2  You can see  CBRE Group  Inc    NYSE CBRE    a commercial real estate services and investment company  has a Zacks Rank  2 and a VGM Score of B  The expected EPS growth rate for 3 5 years is 13  Dave   Buster s Entertainment  Inc    NASDAQ PLAY    which owns and operates entertainment and dining venues  has a VGM Score of B and a Zacks Rank  2

8489,230004,BJRI,Brinker  EAT  Strategic Plans Bode Well  Should You Hold ,opinion,"Shares of Brinker International  Inc    NYSE EAT   are riding high on aggressive expansion and sales building initiatives  digital capabilities as well as remodeling efforts  Evidently  the stock has rallied 33 7  in a year  outperforming the  s 3 9  upside 
However  a slowdown in some of the key international markets and overall high costs associated with restaurant operations remain major concerns for the company  Let s delve deeper 
Hidden Catalysts
Brinker remains steadfast in its goal to boost traffic and revenues through a range of sales building initiatives like streamlining of menu and its innovation  strengthening its value proposition  better food presentation  advertising campaigns  kitchen system optimization and introduction of better service platform  In 2016  the company also initiated a strategic plan   Vision 2020   to propel revenues 
Markedly  this plan focuses on menu innovation in Chili s  and consistent improvement in service and atmosphere to differentiate the brand and gain market traction for achieving long term earnings per share growth target in the 10 15  range 
Furthermore  this Zacks Rank  3  Hold  company is gearing up for international expansion  especially in faster growing emerging markets  Though it is experiencing some headwinds in the Middle East  Brinker s Latin American business has been solid 
Additionally  the company is on the lookout to expand its brand in existing markets and enter new ones  In fiscal 2018  it expects to open 38 to 43 restaurants globally  which will include new markets like Panama  Chile and Vietnam 
Meanwhile  in third quarter fiscal 2018  Brinker s global business partners in Latin America and the Pacific witnessed positive comps  indicating strong demand for the brand worldwide  Currently  the company is under negotiation to expand its footprint in China 
Brinker is also investing heavily in technology driven initiatives  like online ordering  to augment sales and boost guest services  This is because the digital wave has hit the U S  fast casual restaurant sector  with many restaurants deploying technology toward enhancing guest experience 
Having installed a table top technology at all the company owned restaurants in partnership with Ziosk  Brinker has now implemented handheld devices across California  This  in turn  is resulting in increased efficiency and speed 

 
Concerns
Higher labor costs owing to increased wages and costs incurred due to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act are expected to continue weighing on profits  Moreover  the collapse of the Republican led bill  which was intended to replace Obamacare  indicates that the Affordable Care Act is here to stay  This means that the restaurant operators will have to continue shouldering increased labor costs  which in turn will hurt margins 
Additionally  costs related to various sales boosting initiatives including advertising expenses along with commodity inflation are expected to continue hurting margins  Thus  the company s profits in the upcoming quarters might remain under pressure despite its cost saving initiatives  In fiscal 2018  Brinker expects restaurant operating margin to be down 65 75 basis points as it invests specifically in its core food equities 
In the coming quarters  Brinker s international comps are also likely to be affected by a slowdown in some of the markets that it operates in  Moreover  the company is highly exposed to threats from various emerging nations  which has been exhibiting decelerating growth for some time due to several macro headwinds 
This  in turn  might limit discretionary spending and hurt the company s top line  For instance  Brinker s business in the Middle East is widely challenged  given the adverse economic factors impacting the region 
Key Picks
Some better ranked stocks in the same space are Wingstop Inc    NASDAQ WING    BJ s Restaurants Inc    NASDAQ BJRI   and Dine Brands Global  Inc    NYSE DIN    While Wingstop and BJ s Restaurants sport a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   Dine Brands carries a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see

Such a feat was achieved despite questions about employers  ability to find skilled labor  headwinds associated with slowdown in cyclical part of the economy  including housing  and distortions from hurricanes 
By the way  the jobless rate ticked down to 3 7   the lowest since 1969  The real unemployment rate  including those who are underemployed and discouraged  also known as the U6 rate  contracted to 7 4   which is slightly less than last s month s estimate of 7 5   The U6 now stands at a level lower than it was during the 2007 2009 recession

Courtesy of record wage growth  the consumer discretionary sector is  thus  poised to benefit significantly  After all  higher wage growth plays a significant role in driving consumer discretionary spending  Needless to say  among the economic factors that mostly affect demand for consumer discretionary goods is wage growth  If wages keep rising  consumers generally have more discretionary income to spend  In contrast  if wages fall or remain stagnant  demand for such goods decline 
Jobs Report Points to Higher Interest Rates  Banks Gain
Higher pay means that the cost of borrowing for both consumers and businesses is going to go up soon  Higher inflation  in turn  may lead to increased interest rates 
Minutes from the U S  Federal Reserve s September meeting had already confirmed that the central bank is most likely to continue hiking benchmark lending rates at a gradual pace this year and beyond  Majority of the Fed policymakers said that rate hikes  would most likely be consistent  with economic expansion  strength in labor market and the current period of firming inflation 
As the stage for gradual rate hikes is set  institutions such as banks will see a ramp up in profits  Higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer term assets  such as loans  with shorter term liabilities

8505,230020,RS,Margin Debt And The Next Stock Market Crash,opinion,The latest fear on Wall Street is that record levels of margin debt may end up toppling the stock market rally  NYSE margin debt recently reached its highest level since 2007 before the last major stock market peak and credit crash  Stephen Suttmeier  technical research analyst at Bank of America  noted that margin debt rose 28  in March from a year ago to  380 billion  That figure is slightly below the July 2007 peak of  381 billion  although analysts speculate that April s margin debt totals  which haven t yet been released  have already surpassed this mark Suttmeier told The Wall Street Journal that the currently high margin debt levels are  contrarian bearish   While high margin levels have coincided with major market tops of the past  there s an important twist to this particular indicator  In order to confirm that a top has been made  margin debt levels normally turn down before major indices like the S P 500 peak  See the following graph  courtesy BoA Merrill Lynch  It s no surprise people have been taking on more risk as the market has moved to record highs   writes Steven Russolillo in The Wall Street Journal   But the question is what happens when the easy ride higher turns south and some of that margin debt turns into margin calls   The article goes on to warn of a potential selling wave if stock prices reverse and margin calls lead to mass liquidation   A wave of margin calls can worsen selling pressure on stocks and was seen as partly to blame for the market s woes during the financial crisis   writes Russolillo  While it s true that rising margin debt levels should be viewed as a potential yellow flag for the stock market  other indicators don t yet suggest the rally has reached bubble proportions  As economist Ed Yardeni pointed out in a recent    Valuation multiples aren t flashing irrational exuberance yet  but that could change quickly in a debt financed melt up of stock prices   Yardeni suggests that while NYSE margin requirements have been unchanged since January 1974  Fed Chairman Bernanke could boost the requirement later this year in response to charges that the Fed s stimulus program is leading to a stock market bubble  Lest investors forget  margin requirement hikes can take a huge toll on investor psychology and can completely take the wind out of a market s sails  Remember the gold and silver margin increases of 2011  anyone  GoldThe price of gold was last quoted at  1 422  basis June futures  after slipping on May 10  After a decent short covering rally since bottoming in mid April  gold has encountered resistance at the overhead 30 day moving average intersection at the  1 478 level   The all important test of support following the April bottom is likely underway  This is normal following a major bottom and recoil rally like we ve seen in the gold market in recent weeks  After the initial rally it s common for price to test the previous low   either by making a higher low  a double bottom or  if worse comes to worse  a lower low  The current pullback and test of support over the next few days will be very revealing as to just how strong and serious the buyers really are  One reason I haven t recommended long positions in gold yet despite the recent close above the 15 day MA is the fact that gold s relative strength line still hasn t broken its downward trend  Currently the relative strength line for the gold ETF  IAU  is testing the recent lows in a sign of relative weakness  Relative strength  RS  isn t an infallible indicator for gauging the upside or downside potential of gold but at the same time it s not something to be ignored  An upward reversal of the RS line from here would be a welcome change of gold s internal condition and would give us greater confidence in gold s internal strength going forward ,2013-05-12,Clif Droke,https://www.investing.com/analysis/margin-debt-and-the-next-stock-market-crash-166558,166558

8512,230027,BJRI,Cost Savings To Aid BJ s Restaurants   BJRI  Q1 Earnings,opinion,BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI   is scheduled to report first quarter 2018 results on Apr 26  after market close The company has been undertaking various sales building initiatives that are expected to have reflected in the to be reported quarter s top line  Additionally  vigorous cost containment initiatives are expected to have aided earnings in the first quarter  Despite bearing the brunt of soft consumer demand and pressurized sales in the past few quarters  the company s efforts to serve distinguished menu to customers and enhancement of digital capabilities have marked a turnaround Also  in a year s time  BJ Restaurants  shares have rallied 14 1  outperforming the  s gain of 6 7  Let s take a look at how the company s revenues and earnings will shape up in the to be reported quarter Several Initiatives to Aid Top LineBJ s Restaurants has implemented several major sales building initiatives in 2017 that have been tested and are expected to have contributed positively in the first quarter  In 2017  the restaurant crew mastered advanced cooking methods and also became skillful in taking orders from the recently installed hand held ordering tablets  Also  the company s slow roasted menu launch has become a huge success Notably  off premise sales increased to 7  of the company s revenues in the last reported quarter compared with its industry average of nearly 10 11   Given the fact that off premise sales represent a considerable revenue growth opportunity  the company has been undertaking various efforts to enhance delivery and take out services  In fact  it intends to leverage its highly rated mobile app and website  along with new third party delivery partners to drive growth in off premise sales  The company currently has delivery available in about 149 restaurants  with another 23 scheduled to be added by the end of the first quarter Also  BJ s has also developed a deep pipeline of new menu items  focusing on its EnLIGHTened menu category  featuring its new super food options  Moreover  the company expects to offset some of the labor pressure through prudent menu pricing and design  Additionally  its promotional offers along with bundled lunch offerings should boost sales and drive guest traffic  Additionally  the restaurant has undertaken several digital initiatives to improve the speed of service  and thereby enhance guest experience and profitability Owing to these sales building efforts  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter revenues is pegged at  274 03 million  reflecting 6 3  year over year growth Cost Cutting Efforts to Drive EarningsAlthough high costs are prevalent in the restaurant space  various cost savings and efficiency initiatives of the company are expected to have aided margins and thereby earnings in the first quarter  The consensus estimate for the quarter s earnings is pegged at 54 cents per share  suggesting 28 6  growth from the prior year quarter The company is committed to improve its operating margins through cost containment initiatives  Notably  BJ s Restaurants is focusing more on its smaller prototype restaurants that cost roughly  1 million less than the prior prototype  This helps in reducing operating costs  Due to lesser food wastage and improved labor productivity  these new restaurants generate higher margins  Moreover  in 2017  the company initiated an additional  5 million of efficiency savings in areas such as sourcing  distribution  supplies and maintenance Also  gauging the high cost infested restaurant operating environment  it has decided to put off new openings for some time  and focus even more on its enterprise resources and build sales instead  This may turn out to be favorable as it would provide some margin momentum Our Quantitative Model Does Not Predict a BeatBJ s Restaurants does not have the right combination of two main ingredients   a positive  and a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  or higher   for increasing the odds of an earnings beat Zacks ESP  The company has an Earnings ESP of  3 11   You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  Zacks Rank  BJ s Restaurants has a Zacks Rank  3 As it is  we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially

right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter Domino s   NYSE DPZ   has an Earnings ESP of  0 20  and holds a Zacks Rank  3  The company is scheduled to report first quarter

8514,230029,BJRI,BJ s Restaurants  BJRI  Opens Sixth Outlet In Maryland,opinion,"BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI   recently announced the launch of its sixth restaurant in Maryland  Located in Hagerstown  the restaurant seats roughly 230 guests and features wide ranging menu  Notably  this is the second unit opening in 2018 and the company also has plans to open its third outlet in June at Albany 
Notably  for quite some time now  BJ s Restaurants is trying to fend off competition and a difficult sales environment by focusing more on sales building initiatives  To this end  the company had decided to put off new openings for some time but did not completely refrain from it  as a slowdown in unit growth can potentially dent the restaurant s sales 
Slowdown in Unit Growth to Aid Margins but Dent Revenues
After reducing the number of restaurant openings to 10 in fiscal 2017 compared with 17 in fiscal 2016  the company plans to open just four to six restaurants in fiscal 2018  The reduction in new openings is due to the company s continued belief that the sales headwinds in the industry call for greater focus on traffic and sales building initiatives 
We believe that this particular strategy of slowing down its unit growth may turn out to be favorable for the company  as it would provide some margin momentum and maximize its free cash flow  These when combined with the company s conservative balance sheet would provide more flexibility for sales building capital and share repurchases  going forward 
However  the slowdown in the company s development plan might somewhat dent its sales growth  As it is  the company s expanse in the global market is limited  While several other restaurant bigwigs like Yum  Brands   NYSE YUM    McDonald s   NYSE MCD   and Domino s   NYSE DPZ   are capitalizing on the emerging market potential  BJ s Restaurants seems to be slow on this front  We believe that the company needs to spread its presence beyond the United States in order to offset the impact of cutthroat competition in the saturated domestic market 
What s the Key Growth Driver 
BJ s Restaurants implemented several major sales building initiatives that have contributed positively to the company s first quarter sales  With increased focus on productivity and efficiency  along with a plan of balanced restaurant opening  the company is further heading toward near and long term operating success 
The company s key needle moving initiatives continued to drive substantial revenues in the first quarter of 2018  In 2017  the restaurant crew mastered advanced cooking methods and also became skillful in taking orders via hand held ordering tablets  In fact  results from these initiatives have been positive so far 
Notably  in the fourth quarter of 2017  off premise sales increased to 7  of the company s revenues compared with its industry average of nearly 10 11   Further  in the first quarter of 2018  BJ s Restaurants  off premise business grew more than 30   constituting 7 5  of the company s revenues and is 150 basis points  bps  higher than the prior year quarter  Looking at this trend  management believes that there is a tremendous opportunity for further building the off premise part of business 
Meanwhile  BJ s Restaurants  extensive focus on refining and streamlining its menu is the key driver for improved traffic  The company s slow roasted menu  launched in 2017  has become a huge success  It has significantly boosted average check  with high incident rates 
Owing to such efforts  BJ s Restaurants  shares have returned 13 7  over the past year  outpacing the  s rally of 1 5  
The company currently carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

8518,230033,BJRI,5 Mid Cap Stocks To Tackle Trade War   Overvaluation Fears,opinion,"Mid caps are an often overlooked investing option  These securities are viewed as big and safe compared to the highly volatile small cap exposure  But when compared to the stability of large caps  these are relatively risky bets  However  investors ignoring this key segment of the investing spectrum should note that the present development in the global economy makes the way clear for mid cap investing 
Why to Stay Away from Large Caps
Notably  large caps have wider foreign exposure and thus any negative development pertaining to the global economy does not bode well for this category  This section is fraught with risks emanating from ongoing trade tensions  likely strength in the greenback and a slowdown in several foreign economies 
Trade tension between China and the United States has escalated of late with China levying tariffs on a variety of U S  goods  including crude and gasoline  as a retaliation to President Donald Trump s  levy on Chinese imports 
If this was not enough  in the latest G 7 summit  Trump criticized allies  mainly Canada s prime minister Trudeau  which gives cues of the trade conflict even with the G 7 cronies  Worries over the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement  NAFTA  also flared up 
On the other hand  several developed economies  including the Eurozone  have been slowing down  The Eurozone economy expanded  sequentially in the first quarter of 2018  following a 0 7  rise in the previous period  Canada s first quarter GDP marked the slowest expansion since a 0 3  shrinkage in the second quarter of 2016  Meanwhile  the British economy expanded 0 1  sequentially in the quarter  representing the lowest growth since a 0 1  contraction in the fourth quarter of 2012 
This sudden slowdown in foreign economies might make some investors cautious about large cap stocks because of their higher foreign exposure  Prospects of a stronger dollar  given a hawkish Fed  may also hurt such stocks 
How Long Will the Small Cap Rally Last 
Meanwhile  the U S  economy has been on the steady ground  This boosted small cap equities  which are mostly domestic focused   Apart from this  insulation from trade tensions and upbeat earnings sent small caps rallying in recent times 
But at   small cap stocks are pricier than the bigger counterparts in the S P  which has an expected P E ratio of 17 5x  per Bloomberg  The difference of 2 84 times has increased from 2 16 at the end of March  So  the overvaluation of smaller caps is concerning 
Reasons for Mid Cap Investing
All in all  the situation is not favorable for small or large caps  Thus  it is advisable to take a middle of the road approach and gain exposure to a space that offers best of both worlds  In this regard  we highlight a few mid cap stocks that have a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   a market cap between  1 billion to  5 billion and a year to date price increase of more than 50

8526,230041,RS,Is Reliance Steel  RS  A Worthy Pick For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co    NYSE RS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Reliance Steel has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 16  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 22  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  Reliance Steel s current PE level puts it way below its midpoint of 14 11 over the past five years The stock s PE also compares quite favorably with the Industrial Products Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 17 64  This indicates that the stock is undervalued right now  compared to its peers Meanwhile  Reliance Steel has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 10 31  which is slightly higher than the current level  So  it is fair to expect an increase in the share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  Reliance Steel has a P S ratio of 0 55  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 3x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  Reliance Steel currently has a Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Reliance Steel a solid choice for value investors What About the Stock Overall Though Reliance Steel might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of D  This gives RS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen one upward and two downward revisions over the past sixty days  while the current year estimates have seen two upward revisions and two downward revisions in the past sixty days This has had a mixed impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate inched down 0 8  over the past two months  while the current year estimate has inched up 0 2   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co  Price and Consensus   Such mixed analyst sentiments is the reason why the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and it is the reason why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineReliance Steel is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Despite a strong industry rank  among Top 41  of more than 250 industries   with a Zacks Rank  3  it is hard to get too excited about the stock Also  over the past two years  the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick This Could Be the Fastest Way to Grow Wealth in 2019Research indicates one sector is poised to deliver a crop of the best performing

8541,230056,BJRI,Small Business Sentiment Second Best In 45 Years  5 Picks,opinion,On Mar 13  the National Federation of Independent Business  NFIB  released data for its small cap business optimism index  which rose to its second highest level in February since its inception 45 years ago  Trump administration s tax overhaul policies and strengthening domestic economy supported these gains Small cap stocks are believed to have a higher level of volatility compared to their large and mid cap counterparts but provide comparatively better returns  Moreover  recent trade war uncertainty makes these largely domestically focused stocks a strong investment option  Also  small cap stocks will show greater growth potential following strong business optimism and a weak tax environment  which makes them great picks at this point Small Business Sentiment Index Hovers Near Record HighThe NFIB small business optimism index increased 0 7 points to 107 6 in February  Out of the 10 major components in the index  seven registered an increase Meanwhile  the three key components of the index  expectation of higher sales prospects  improving economy and strong inventory rose 3   2  and 2   respectively  Inventory investment was best since 2000  while earnings trends were strongest since 1987  Also  capital outlays were the biggest since 2004 NFIB President Juanita Duggan said  the historically high readings  highlighted that Trump s new steel and aluminum tariffs and lower taxes will play a  transformative  role for small businesses  Additionally  NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg said small business are thriving in ways which have not been witnessed in more than  a decade  Trump s Economic Policies in FocusAfter weeks of market jitters  Trump finally signed the tariff plan into law on Mar 8  slapping tariffs of 25  on steel imports and 10  on aluminum imports from other countries  It will come into effect within 15 days  However  Canada and Mexico were exempted from these new U S  tariffs    Moreover  Trump s protectionist stance raised concerns over a possible retaliation by other countries with similar kind of moves  Investors have been concerned about prospects of a trade war  Fears of this nature could actually benefit small cap companies  which have limited exposure to the global market compared to their mid  and large cap counterparts Additionally  last year  the much awaited Tax Bill was finally signed by President Trump in the Oval office  The Tax Bill  now known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017  permanently slashes corporate tax rates from 35  to 21   Additionally  on Mar 13  the President while talking to U S  Representative for Texas  Kevin Brady raised expectations for  additional tax cuts  as he said that he wishes for a  phase two  in tax cuts Before the tax cut  companies on the small cap index Russell 2000 had to pay a median effective tax rate of 31 9  while the larger  multi national companies on the S P 500 pay a median effective tax rate of 28   according to Thomson Reuters data  This is why Trump s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 is expected to benefit small cap stocks to a great extent Our ChoicesStrong business sentiment  Trump s pro growth economic policies  stronger domestic economy and upbeat jobs report bode well for small cap stocks  Moreover  possibility of a trade war between major countries following Trump s new tariff laws makes small cap stocks a wise investment choice Given this backdrop  it makes sense to bet on small cap stocks  which are included in the Russell 2000 Index  Notably  this prominent small cap index has gained 2 7  in the year to date period These five stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   However  picking winning stocks may be difficult  This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM Score Almost Family  Inc    NASDAQ AFAM   is a home healthcare services provider in the United States Almost Family has a Zacks Rank

8544,230059,BJRI,4 Stocks To Serve Better Returns Amid Restaurant Recovery,opinion,After surviving the seven quarter long tragedy of declining comps  the U S  restaurant industry received a pleasant surprise in the fourth quarter of 2017  According to TDn2K s The Restaurant Industry Snapshot  comps for the fourth quarter were up 0 4   comparing favorably with the third quarter s comps decline of 1  Should We Be Optimistic of Growth The positive momentum in sales growth in the fourth quarter was not enough to outweigh the sluggish growth of the industry in 2017  For the full year  comps declined 1 1   the same as in 2016  Traffic for the year also fell 3 2  Amid declining traffic trends for the year  comps growth may have been aided by promotions and discounting strategies by restaurant managements  Over the past year  the restaurant  s shares have returned 14 9   underperforming the growth of 16 2  for the S P 500 However  most of the restaurants are undertaking aggressive sales building strategies to drive demand  The fourth quarter already bore the fruit of these efforts  We believe that 2018 is set to witness an overall improvement in restaurant sales given an increase in consumer discretionary spending coupled with the restaurant bigwig s sales improvement efforts Restaurant Operators Bullish About Industry ScenarioA turnover for most restaurants showed up in November 2017 and is ongoing  Moreover  according to TDn2K market research  the overall restaurant industry is starting to improve  Although not all brands may have an opportunity to rake

8545,230060,BJRI,4 Retail Stocks To Buy Despite Soft February Sales,opinion,U S  retail sales remained soft in the month of February per the recent data released by the United States Commerce Department  reflecting a decline of 0 1   way behind the consensus expectation of 0 4  growth  January data  however  was revised upward to show sales dipping 0 1  instead of decline of 0 3  as previously reported  It marked three months of decline in a row  since April 2012   Among the various components of the retail sales  vehicles sales declined 0 9  in February  according to the monthly report  Furthermore  furniture sales  health care and personal care sales  declined 0 8  and 0 4   respectively  Sales at gasoline stores were down 1 2  and food sales decreased 0 1  However  the month s bright spots were a 1 9  increase in building materials against a decline of 1 7  in January and 0 2  restaurant sales growth from a 0 1  gain the previous month  Also  sales at non store retailers jumped 1  after a sharp fall in January Is There a Cause for Concern Following the data release  J P  Morgan cut its first quarter 2018 GDP forecast from 2 5  to 2   while Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS  reduced the same to 1 8  from 2   The Atlanta Fed s GDP estimate fell to 1 9   down from 2 5  Given that retail sales for the first two months of the first quarter were not so strong  its contribution to the quarter s GDP should be below than last quarter and weigh on economic growth  In the fourth quarter  the economy grew 2 5   but expectations are growth of 3  per the third revision which is due later this month However  looking further  core retail sales  which exclude sales related to vehicles  gasoline  building materials and food services and more closely indicate GDP trends   inched up 0 1  after remaining unchanged in the month of January  The number was  however  lower than the consensus estimate of a 0 5  gain  Also  the monthly report states that retail sales increased 4  year over year  provided some breather Economists believe that an increase in spending on services should buoy first quarter retail sales results and there is the likelihood of strong service spending given solid recent data Strong Service Sector GrowthInstitute for Supply Management  ISM  data for the month of February showed that the non manufacturing index  NMI  was 59 5  topping analysts  estimates of 58 4  This was also more than an average of 57 for all of 2017  NMI reading above 49  indicates an expansion for the broader economy The non manufacturing index saw uninterrupted expansion for the 97th consecutive month and indicated that the broader economy is on track for steady growth this year  Expansion was witnessed in sectors related to education services  transportation and warehousing  utilities  real estate  finance   insurance  healthcare  construction  mining  retail trade  agriculture and information  Service spending trends thus look rosier  which should aid U S  retail sales in the first quarter of 2018   Alongside  the environment for the retail sector remains favorable against the backdrop of economic strength underpinned by gradual wage acceleration  a 17 year low unemployment rate and rising consumer confidence  and a reduction in tax rate   The  sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  has put up a good show by advancing roughly 10 7  in the last three months  comfortably outperforming the S P 500 s growth of approximately 3 1  Top 4 PicksGiven the prospective growth of retail sales  investors may consider buying sound stocks from this space  We have  thus  selected four stocks that should be accretive  to your portfolio  These stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy   Our search was also narrowed down with a

industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  BJ s Restaurants has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18 33  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 18 62  If we focus on the long term PE trend  BJ s Restaurants  current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Retail Wholesale sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 28 21  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers   We should also point out that BJ s Restaurants has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 18 75  which is tad higher than the current level  So it is fair to expect an increase in the company s share price in the near term P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  BJ s Restaurants has a P S ratio of about 0 80  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 36 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  BJRI is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  BJ s Restaurants currently has a Zacks Value Score of B  putting it into the top 40  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes BJ s Restaurants a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too    For example  the PEG ratio for BJ s Restaurants is just 1 29  a level that is far lower than the industry average of 2 13  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio comes in at 7 37  which is lower than the industry average of 12 16  Clearly  BJRI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall    Though BJ s Restaurants might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of B and a Momentum Score of A  This gives BJRI a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores    Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen one estimate go lower in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction while the current year estimate has seen one downward revision compared to two upward in the same time period      This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased by 1 4  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has inched up by 0 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below BJ s Restaurants  Inc  Price and Consensus    Despite this positive trend  the stock has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   which indicates expectations of in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  BJ s Restaurants is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 38  of more than 250 industries  further instils our confidence  In fact  over the past two years  the Zacks Retail   Restaurants industry has clearly outperformed the market at large  as you can see below  However  a Zacks Rank  3 makes it is hard to get too excited about this company overall So  despite a Zacks Rank  3  we believe that bullish analyst sentiment and favorable industry factors make this value stock a compelling pick Wall Street s Next Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time  It s a once in a generation opportunity to invest in pure genius ,2019-07-14,Zacks Investment

8571,230086,BJRI,Yum  Brands  YUM  Gains From Refranchising  High Costs Rife,opinion,"Yum  Brands    NYSE YUM   robust efforts to enhance digital capabilities  refranchising attempts and transformation strategies continue to be encouraging  However  higher costs continue to hurt the company s profits  Also  macroeconomic headwinds and unfavorable currency translation might limit the company s revenue growth 
Last month  Yum  Brands reported   beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on earnings but missing the same on revenues Adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents  Further  earnings increased 21 5  year over year  The shift to refranchising substantially boosted the company s operating margin and earnings per share  and the trend is expected to continue 
Notably  the company s shares have gained 22 2  in the past year  outperforming the  s gain of 11 7  
Let s look into the strengths and risks associated with the company 
Digital Initiatives Drive Top Line Growth
Yum  Brands had undertaken a three year strategic transformation plan to drive growth at KFC  Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands that involve employing greater focus on the development ofits three iconic global brands  To build traffic through greater consumer satisfaction  the company is continuously developing digital and technological capabilities 
Advanced technological implementations to improve guest experience are also proving to be fruitful for the company s international business  Yum  Brands believes in maximizing consumer satisfaction to drive revenues 
To this end the company is focusing on building a superlative loyalty program with a large and growing database to help drive future sales  We believe that these initiatives will drive traffic and comps in the coming quarters 
In fourth quarter 2017  Yum  Brands announced a partnership with online food delivery platform Grubhub to enhance online sales and delivery from its restaurants  Additionally  the company implemented various digital features in mobile and online platforms in the fourth quarter across all its brand segments to improve guest experience  To enhance its delivery services  the company announced Pizza Hut s partnership with Toyota that will facilitate delivery of pizzas via driverless vehicles  showcasing innovation for both the companies 
Refranchising Aids Earnings
Yum  Brands has adopted a de risking strategy by reducing its ownership of restaurants through refranchising  In fourth quarter 2017  the company increased its franchise ownership to 97   It is committed toward becoming at least 98  franchised and to possess less than 1 000 company owned restaurants by the end of 2018 
Refranchising a large portion of the system reduces the company s capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth and higher Return on Equity  ROE   Alongside  free cash flow will continue to grow  facilitating reinvestments to increase brand recognition and shareholder return  Remarkably  this shift to refranchising has substantially benefited the company s operating margin over the years  
High Costs   Unfavorable Currency as Potential Headwinds
Due to continual expansion in international markets  the company is highly exposed to various macroeconomic headwinds  Thus  the company s earnings remain highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates 
Also  an increase in the cost of employee wages  benefits and insurance  as well as other operating costs such as rent and energy costs have led to a significant pressure on the company s margins   A competitive retail environment also puts pressure on the restaurants  costs 
Zacks Rank   Stocks to Consider
Yum  Brands carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  
A few better ranked stocks in the U S  restaurant space include BJ s Restaurants   NASDAQ BJRI    Brinker International   NYSE EAT   and Darden Restaurants   NYSE DRI    each carrying a Zacks Rank  2  Buy   You can see  
BJ s  Brinker and Darden s earnings for 2018 are expected to increase 27   6 6  and 18 4   respectively

8587,230102,RS,Is Reliance Steel  RS  A Profitable Pick For Value Investors   ,opinion,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co    NYSE RS   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE Ratio A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  Reliance Steel has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13 44  as you can see in the chart below  This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 20 08  If we focus on the long term PE trend  Reliance Steel s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years  Further  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Industrial Products sector s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 18 52  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers    We should also point out that Reliance Steel has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of just 12 57  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for Reliance Steel stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings  Right now  Reliance Steel has a P S ratio of about 0 72  This is lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 47 right now   Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years   If anything  RS is in the higher end of its range in the time period from a P S metric  suggesting some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms  Broad Value Outlook In aggregate  Reliance Steel currently has a Zacks Value Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes Reliance Steel a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too    For example  the PEG ratio for Reliance Steel is just 0 72  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 96  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Clearly  RS is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles      What About the Stock Overall    Though Reliance Steel might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of D  This gives RS a Zacks VGM score   or its overarching fundamental grade   of A   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores   Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction while the current year estimate has seen four upward revision compared to no downward in the same time period      This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased by 1 8  in the past two months  while the current year estimate has improved by 2 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below Reliance Steel   Aluminum Co  Price and Consensus
 
   This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term Bottom Line  Reliance Steel is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front  A strong industry rank  among top 18  of more than 250 industries  and a Zacks Rank  2 further instils our confidence However  over the past two years  the Zacks Metal Products   Distribution industry has clearly underperformed the market at large  as you can see below  So  value investors might want to wait for industry trends to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick 5 Stocks Set to DoubleEach was hand picked by a Zacks expert as the  1 favorite stock to gain  100  or more in 2020  Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth Most of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar  which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor ",2019-12-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-reliance-steel-rs-a-profitable-pick-for-value-investors-200494925,200494925

8593,230108,BJRI,SBUX Vs  YUM  Which Stock Is Poised For Better Q3 Earnings ,opinion,We are in the thick of the Q3 earnings season with results seemingly on solid ground given the positive momentum on the revenue front  Apart from maintaining the above average proportion of positive earnings surprises  the estimate revision trend for the December quarter is quite palpable According to our latest   64 2  of the total market capitalization of S P 500 is already out  As of Oct 27  2017  total earnings for the 272 S P 500 members are up 8 7  year over year on 6 7  higher revenues  Of these  75 7  surpassed earnings estimates  while 66 2  beat revenue expectations A Look at the Restaurant IndustryWe note that the performance of the restaurant industry  under the broader Retail Wholesale sector  has been mixed so far this earnings season  Among the restaurant stocks that have reported  Domino s Pizza Inc    NYSE DPZ   posted robust results  beating earnings and revenue estimates McDonald s Corporation   NYSE MCD   posted mixed third quarter 2017 results  While earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate  revenues fell short of the same  However  Chipotle Mexican Grill  Inc    NYSE CMG   lagged on both fronts Soft consumer spending environment in the U S  restaurant space along with rising costs continue to haunt restaurant chains  Also  the recent hurricanes seem to have negatively impacted results of a number of restaurant companies this earnings season  which includes the likes of BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI      that reported lower than expected results in third quarter fiscal 2017 Nonetheless  innovative operators with strong fundamentals are continuing to exhibit strength even in a not so favorable environment Let s have a sneak peek at two major restaurant stocks scheduled to report earnings tomorrow to see how things are shaping before the announcement Starbucks Corporation   NASDAQ SBUX   is set to report fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results We expect Starbucks  revenues to increase on the back of an addition of new restaurants and positive global comparable store sales or simply comps growth  Starbucks also projected global comps growth at 3 4  for the quarter  Comps in the fiscal fourth quarter are likely to be driven by significant menu innovations like new and improved Bistro Boxes  Seared Steak and Egg Wrap Starbucks  digital offering  Mobile Order and Pay  is also witnessing increased usage and could prove to be a key growth driver in the to be reported quarter as well as in 2017  Again  growth in Starbucks reward members is expected to contribute to its revenue growth in the to be reported quarter The company had earlier revealed that it expects stronger revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year  driven by mid single digit comps including accelerating comps in the United States  Overall  for the fiscal fourth quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at  5 73 billion  implying 0 4  year over year growth With respect to the company s bottom line  Starbucks  EPS is likely to witness a decline in the third quarter due to a rise in cost of sales and higher goodwill and other asset impairment expenses for the closing of 379 Teavana stores  Hence  despite a revenue growth expectation  the coffee giant s margins are likely to narrow due to higher cost of sales as a result of commodity inflation  These headwinds  however  are likely to be offset by lower general and administrative  G A  expenses That said  a challenging environment in the United States restaurant space might be a cause for concern for investors in the near term For the fiscal fourth quarter  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 55 cents a share  reflecting a decrease of 2 5  year over year Meanwhile  our proven model does not conclusively show that Starbucks is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components For the impending quarter  the company has an  of  0 08   Starbucks currently has Zacks Rank  3  Hold   making an earnings prediction uncertain  A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3 for a likely earnings beat  You can see   Read    Starbucks Corporation Price and EPS Surprise    Yum  Brands  Inc    NYSE YUM   is scheduled to report third quarter 2017 numbers before the opening bell Post China business separation  Yum  Brands endeavors to drive growth by employing greater focus on the development of its three iconic global brands  increasing its franchise ownership  and creating a leaner and more efficient cost structure bodes well  This  in turn  is likely to bolster third quarter results Particularly  augmented pace of unit development along with increased investments in technology driven initiatives is anticipated to somewhat drive top line growth in the quarter Coming to the Pizza Hut brand  while the international division might continue doing well  Pizza Hut U S  is expected to post soft results for the quarter despite numerous strategic efforts similar to the last few quarters  Notably  a soft consumer spending environment in the U S  restaurant space is likely to continue restricting revenue growth Meanwhile  KFC s efforts to revamp outlets  focus on its operational excellence  delivery services  innovation and convenience  are expected to continue boosting comps However  Yum  Brands is likely to witness a decline in company sales due to the impact of its strategic refranchising initiative  which  in turn  will lower the company s revenues in the third quarter  A slowdown in emerging markets is likely to further hamper the quarter s performance Overall  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third quarter earnings of 66 cents implies a year over year decline of 39 5   The same for revenues is pegged at  1 39 billion  58 2  lower than the prior year quarter figure Meanwhile  our proven model does not conclusively show that Yum  Brands is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components  For the impending quarter  the company has an Earnings ESP of  1 37   The company currently has

TakeEarnings beat for both the companies remain uncertain  Starbucks and Yum  Brands have delivered positive surprises in the trailing four quarters  However  Yum  Brands  average beat of 7 01  steers

ProQR Therapeutics NV  NASDAQ PRQR  snapped back on Wednesday and maybe breaking out of the two month falling wedge  It jumped 1 70  or 11   to 17 48  on 464 171 shares traded  The volume wasn t great  but it was a little bit of a pick up  We ll see if this means anything  but it did break through the declining topsline  Targets going forward are 20 3 4  21  and then 24 eventually 
Stocks on the Short Side
Grubhub Inc  NYSE GRUB  rallied back to the declining topsline on Wednesday but was still down 1 35  or 2   to 75 46  on 1 9 million shares  It looks like it wants to rollover to 61 62 
IntriCon Corporation  NASDAQ IIN  looks terrible  although it has a nice rising wedge and a bear short opportunity  It was down 57 cents  or 2   to 26 81  on 149 339 shares traded on Wednesday  If it is somewhere near 27 at the declining topsline  it could roll over twice and see 21  or worse 
MGP Ingredients Inc  NASDAQ MGPI  recently formed a bear flag that looks like it may have been breaking on Wednesday  It dropped another 67 cents  or 1 17   to 56 38  on 183 729 shares traded and may be headed down toward 48  Keep an eye on that one

8611,230126,AUDC,6 Stocks To Watch  AUDC  CVNA  ETSY  JNCE  PGNX  TLRA,opinion,"It was kind of a mixed market on Tuesday  A lot of stocks we follow did well and a lot of new ones came to the forefront  For now  let s begin by taking a look at one of our old favorites 
AudioCodes Ltd   AUDC 
AUDC which we were all over last July when it was trading in the 7 8 range  has made it all the way up to 15  or more than doubled  You can see the stair step it s had  recently consolidating in a coiling like pattern  It had a big breakout on Tuesday  jumping 1 44  or 10 11   to 15 69  on 688 237 shares traded  That s the best volume for this stock in a long time  I think that if this stock will make it up to 17  it may extend it all the way up to 21 at some point 
Carvana Co   CVNA 
CVNA after consolidating for three weeks  we re following a huge run that took it from 30 to 60  On Tuesday  it was up another 3 88  or 6 58   to 62 82  on 2 8 million shares  For me  the target has to be a retest of the old highs around 71 72 
Etsy  Inc   ETSY 
ETSY popped out of a wedge on Tuesday  and although not a big one  still  it was up 1 57  or 2 3   to 69 73  on 3 55 million shares  The volume picked up  It looks like it s going to extend to the recent highs at 73 35  If it gets through that  we re looking at 83 85 
Jounce Therapeutics  Inc   JNCE 
JNCE after inversing in a head and shoulder s pattern  it formed a flag  and on Tuesday it popped out of the flag  gaining 37 cents or 5 82   to 6 73  on 418 803 shares traded  All it needs to do now is take out 7 35  and it will be headed to the 8 1 2 9 zone going forward 
Progenics Pharmaceuticals  Inc   PGNX 
PGNX which I put a swing on Tuesday because I believed it was going break out  and it did  but it backed off  A pullback is sometimes a buying opportunity  We ll see  It closed up just 13 cents  or 2 72   to 4 91  on 1 88 million shares  We need to get a follow through on this one  There s some resistance at 5 40  but I m looking for a swing to 6 1 2 
Tilray  Inc   TLRY 
TLRY one of swing trades  is doing great  After the pop and pullback  a wedge formed  It broke out  pulled back and tested  formed a flag  and then broke out again on Tuesday  on a nice 72 cent pop  or 1 14   to 63 83  on 1 3 million shares  I think this stock will get to 7 1 2 quickly  and then it may make it up to 8 1 2 9

Adient plc  ADNT 
Adient  NYSE ADNT  popped 1 50  or 6 9   to 23 21  on 2 million shares on Tuesday  I like this chart so much that I ve been watching it continuously  and I decided on Tuesday  after breaking the falling wedge with some energy and good volume  I would put a swing on it  Now  I m looking for a move to the 26 range  a gap fill to 27 1 2  and then a run to 32 33 
AudioCodes Ltd   AUDC 
AudioCodes  NASDAQ AUDC  a stock we ve been following for a couple years  which I put a swing on back in Oct Nov 2017  has down very well over the last year and a half  On Tuesday  it made a new multi year high  jumping 1 64  or 10   to 18 09  on 1 4 million shares  reaching a high of 18 45  That s the highest level in 20 years  The next target is 25

Iradimed  NASDAQ IRMD  also popped on Tuesday  gaining 75 cents  or 4 08   to 19 14  on 73 010 shares traded  with a high of 19 40  It got up to resistance  Let s see if it can get through this level at 26 16  My next target is 28 1 4  If it gets through that  we could see a run to the top of the channel that comes in about 33 33 1 2 
Luckin Coffee Inc   LK 
Luckin Coffee  NASDAQ LK  is doing well  It exploded on Monday and had a nice follow through on Tuesday  running up 1 78  or 8 23   to 23 40  on 9 4 million shares traded  I m looking for a run to the all time high at 25 96 and take it into the high 20 s 
Microbot Medical Inc   MBOT 
Microbot Medical  NASDAQ MBOT  had a big pop on Tuesday  moving up 1 67  or 32   to 6 95  on 232 734 shares traded  That takes it out of a 2 month base but leaves it at resistance  If it can get up through the next target at 8 1 2  which is my near term target  it could very well fly 
Qudian Inc   QD 
Qudian Inc  NYSE QD  held the trendline and moving averages on Tuesday  and then popped 66 cents  or 8 4   to 8 52  on 6 3 million shares  I m looking for a move to 9 15 for it to get to 11 00

8613,230128,AUDC,ANIK  AUDC  BYND  DBD  OC  OSTK  Stock Charts To Watch,opinion,"Anika Therapeutics  Inc   NASDAQ ANIK  had a major pop on Thursday and exploded 11 78  or 29   to 52 60  on 1 4 million shares  and reaching as high as 56 22  That was the biggest volume in more than a year  You can see the breakaway gap and run up and a strong close  which tells me its ready to move  Although there is resistance here  the next target will have to be 61  Then we re looking at mid to high 60 s 
AudioCodes Ltd   NASDAQ AUDC  continues to push  You can see it breaking out of the coiling type pattern  and also the bottom of the channel  moving average and 50 day  There was a breakout day on an inside day on Wednesday  and on Thursday  it was up 69 cents  or 4   to 18 52  on 447 188 shares traded  I think this stock will go to 21  and then mid 20 s after that 
Beyond Meat  Inc   NASDAQ BYND   which I showed you last weekend that this coil was developing  I said that if it pops  it may run to test the high and take it out  That high was 202ish  On Wednesday  it was up 19 94  or 10   to 222 86  with a high of 222 88  on 9 7 million shares  It s up another 8 61  3 86   to 231 47 in after hours  This is a stock that could run on Friday  The angle that I have it run in might be a quick run into that 250 range  which is my near term target 
Diebold Nixdorf  Incorporated  NYSE DBD  after the decline  broke out and killed it  going from the  30 s range to the 2 3 dollar range  Then it exploded Jan  Feb  and March  taking it from the 2 3 dollar range to Thursday s high at 13 40  On Thursday  it had a breakaway gap and then ran up to 2 88  or 28   to 13 17  on 5 3 million shares  The first level of resistance is 13 17  and the next level comes in at 16 1 2 3 4  which is the next target for DBD 
Owens Corning  NYSE OC  has a beautiful pattern  I love the declining channel  a breakout  a pullback  the base formed  a breakout of two corrective falling wedges  and then the pop out  I put a swing on it on Wednesday and it followed through on Thursday  popping 96 cents  or 1 64   to 59 50  on 1 95 million shares  I m looking for this to make a quick test of the gap at about 64  and then the high 60 s  That s the big one  but the gap is a huge one in the 70 s  Targets are 63  68  70  and 71 going forward 
Overstock com  Inc   NASDAQ OSTK  actually did have a breakout that moved up and then backed off  It was up on a fraction on Thursday  only 10 cents  to 19 21  on 6 7 million shares  Volume picked up  though  It may  if it consolidates  shoot out and test resistance at 19 21  If it gets through that  targets are 23  and then 26 1 2

8614,230129,AUDC,5 Stock Charts To Watch  ABEO  AOSL  AUDC  AVMXY  NERV,opinion,"Abeona Therapeutics Inc  NASDAQ ABEO  has been in a downtrend since 9 00  and change  down to 1 46  not even three weeks ago  It exploded two weeks ago  and has been coiling and consolidating for a couple weeks now  On Wednesday  it popped 28 cents  or 10   to 3 20  on 882 081 shares traded  To me  it looks like it s about to pop and go  If it gets through 3 40  I m looking for 4  and then 4 3 4 as target 
Swing trade  Alpha and Omega  Semiconductor Ltd  NASDAQ AOSL  gained 20 cents  or 1 54   to 13 22  on 73 303 shares traded on Wednesday on an inside day  It looks to me like it s poised to pop  The wedge is right at resistance  If it gets through that zone  16 is your target 
 AudioCodes Ltd   NASDAQ AUDC  has been awesome for a year now  and on Wednesday  it ran 1 02  or 5 06   to 21 18  on 433 488 shares traded  Basically  it broke out from the 6 00 7 00 zone  and since  has tripled  The recent wedge or coil that formed has broken out and been up for six days  having run from under 17 to 21 50  I think it s near the top of the channel  and may have only a little bit left toward 23 24  So  keep an eye on that one 
Swing trade  Avita Medical Ltd   OTC AVMXY  had a key breakout on Wednesday  popping 66 cents  or 9   to 7 94  on 412 222 shares traded  and reaching new all time highs at 7 95  With this kind of pattern  it wouldn t shock me if it went to 11 80  14  and 15

And on Tuesday  local officials have begun urging residents in Florida to evacuate  with Miami Dade County Mayor Carlos A  Gimenez saying at a news briefing  This hurricane is far too powerful  poses far too great a threat for us to delay actions any further  
As Harvey impacted numerous industries here in the U S   Irma is already doing the same  Shares of cruise line companies  for instance  are already getting slammed  while restaurants that have a large presence in Florida are seeing their stocks plummet as well 
Fiesta Restaurant Group   NASDAQ FRGI    which operates Taco Cabana  closed the day down over 5  on Tuesday  while Ruth s Hospitality Group   NASDAQ RUTH   and Outback Steakhouse owner Bloomin  Brands Inc    NASDAQ BLMN   were down less than 1  after regular trading closed

The Fiesta Restaurant Group owns  operates  and franchises fast casual restaurants  It operates its fast casual restaurants under the Pollo Tropical and Taco Cabana brand names  The company s Pollo Tropical restaurants offer various Caribbean inspired food  and Taco Cabana restaurants offer a selection of Mexican food  As of January 1  2017  it had 177 company owned Pollo Tropical restaurants  166 company owned Taco Cabana restaurants  and 29 franchised Pollo Tropical restaurants in the United States and abroad  The company was incorporated in 2011 and is headquartered in Dallas  Texas

Potential Reasons For Insider Buying
We define fundamental metrics and present charts below that may help explain why insiders are buying shares EBITDA is defined as Earnings before Interest  Taxes  Depreciation  and Amortization  It is a commonly used metric in valuation as a proxy for operating profitability because it provides a cleaner picture of overall profitability  especially when benchmarking against comparable companies  This is because it ignores non operating costs that can be affected by certain items such as a company s financing decisions or political jurisdictions 
Projected 5 year EBITDA CAGR is the average annual growth rate of EBITDA over a five year period  It s calculated as follows  5yr CAGR     EBITDA FY 5   EBITDA FY      1 5 years    1  The chart below plots the five year EBITDA compounded annual growth rate for Fiesta Restaurant Group and its peers 
source  finbox ioGoing forward  analysts forecast that Fiesta Restaurant Group  s EBITDA will reach  85 million by fiscal year 2021 representing a five year CAGR of 6 9   The company s projected 5 year EBITDA CAGR is slightly below LOCO  8 4   and well above BH   2 1    BJRI  2 9   and BOJA  3 3   
Typically  companies expected to grow at a higher rate relative to their peers will also trade at higher valuation multiples  However  Fiesta Restaurant Group s forward EBITDA multiple of 6 3x is only above BH  5 7x  and below BJRI  6 4x   BOJA  8 2x  and LOCO  8 1x  as illustrated below 
source  finbox ioThe fundamental charts above indicate that the company s stock may be trading at a discount while insiders are likely adding shares while the company s valuation is relatively low compared to its peer group  Value investors may want to look further into Fiesta Restaurant Group ",2017-09-12,Finbox io,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-insiders-continue-to-buy-fiesta-restaurant-group-200212880,200212880

8621,230136,BJRI,Domino s Rides On Traffic Boosting Efforts Despite Woes,opinion,"Despite the prevailing challenging restaurant environment  Domino s Pizza  Inc    NYSE DPZ   has managed to hold its own  The company s revenues and earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing five quarters 
Moreover  the company has been reporting positive same store sales domestically and internationally for the past 25 and 94 consecutive quarters  respectively  Going forward  the company s initiatives on the digital front  focus on re imaging and other sales boosting strategies are expected to help sustain the excellent comps trend and drive growth   
Growth Drivers
Domino s continues to boost sales through regular limited time offers  Also  the company s remodeling initiative is anticipated to continue enhancing its potential as a brand and augment guest experience  The recent launch of bread twists is also expected to favorably impact the company s performance third quarter 2017 onwards 
Meanwhile  Domino s world class digital ordering platforms like Google  NASDAQ GOOGL  Home  Facebook  NASDAQ FB  Messenger  Apple  NASDAQ AAPL  Watch  Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  Echo  Twitter and ordering via a Pizza emoji on text should further continue to increase digital orders  Notably  the extended ways to order a pizza has kept it in the forefront of digital ordering and customer convenience 
The company is also working toward reducing its ownership of restaurants and is focusing more on re franchising as it minimizes capital requirements and facilitates earnings per share growth as well as ROE expansion Markedly  Domino s recently completed recapitalization deal also makes cash available for potential special dividend and share repurchases  depending upon the board s approval 
Apart from these initiatives  Domino s commitment to expand presence in the high growth international market to boost its business bode well  The company s international growth continues to be strong and diversified across markets  driven by exceptional unit level economics 
Potential Headwinds
Though the company s sales building efforts are impressive and should offer long term advantages  costs related to the same could continue hurting margins in the near term  Also  higher labor costs might pressurize the margins 
Furthermore  given its sizeable international operations  Domino s is exposed to risks of fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact the results of the company 
Also  a challenging industry backdrop remains a potent cause of concern for some restaurant chains like The Cheesecake Factory Inc    NASDAQ CAKE    BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI    Jack in the Box  Inc    NASDAQ JACK   and others  Though pizza giants such as Domino s have been comparatively faring well so far  the continued slowdown in the industry at large might hamper their prospects  going forward 
Bottom Line
Regardless of certain headwinds  Domino s operational advantages  given its market share and scale  along with insistent focus on innovation and execution of growth strategy are anticipated to aid the stock in maintaining its solid performance

8625,230140,BJRI,7 Restaurant Stocks To Avoid Amid Industry Woes   Harvey Blows,opinion,"Hurricane Harvey s devastation has ranged far and wide  with heavy rainfall and flooding continuing to hit parts of Texas   particularly Houston   and Louisiana 
Houston is the fourth most populous city in the United States and represents about 2  of the country s total restaurant presence  In fact  according to the country s official website  Houston residents are more likely to eat out than any other city in the country 
Notably  the impact of the storm on restaurant sales could last for a long period now  depending on the severity of property damage  As outlets remain closed for repairs  workers are displaced  or residents focus their funds on rebuilding their homes  restaurant sales will largely suffer 
Per a Canaccord analyst  as reported in a CNBC article   In some cases  we think the lingering effects will carry well into September and likely into Q4  
Harvey Adds to the Already Soft Industry Backdrop
Over the last few quarters  the U S  restaurants space has not been too enticing for investors  Despite economic growth  somewhat lower energy prices and higher income  consumers increased their spending only modestly on dining out  which resulted in low consumption  This is because along with wage growth inflation is also on the rise  which translates to lower real income and thus less disposable income 
Moreover  as consumers demand high quality products at lower prices  it is pushing grocery stores to decrease their food prices in order to remain competitive  This  in turn  is resulting in a bigger gap between food at home and food away from home indices 
Consequently  same store sales growth has been dull in a difficult sales environment  Traffic too has been weak  In fact  the second quarter of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of negative same store sales for the restaurant industry as a whole  thereby continuing the somber mood 
Thus  the Zacks  industry ranks in the Bottom 9  out of more than 250 industries  The industry has also underperformed the broader S P 500 market in the last year  recording a growth of 5 8  while the market grew more than 13 5  
Moreover  while the industry delivered an EPS growth of negative 2 27  year over year in second quarter 2017  the same is projected to increase 3 9  in the current quarter  once again less than S P 500 market s projected growth of 9 6  

Stocks You Should Avoid Right Now
The combination of these above mentioned factors is likely to spell trouble for the restaurant stocks listed below 
Jack in the Box  Inc    NASDAQ JACK   has 70  of its restaurants in the Texas and California markets and thus is highly prone to damages from Harvey along with ongoing macro woes  The company has witnessed its Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter and current year earnings revise downward by 7 1  and 3 6   respectively  over the past month  While analysts were already pessimistic about the stock s prospects  the recent storm could make it worse  Currently  the company has a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
About 41  of Chuy s Holdings  Inc  s   NASDAQ CHUY   restaurants are located in Texas  thus exposing it largely to the region s conditions  The stock has seen current quarter and current year earnings estimates revise downward by 14 3  and 4 6   respectively  over the past month  It currently has a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  
As Buffalo Wild Wings  Inc    NASDAQ BWLD   continues to grapple with rising chicken wing costs coupled with higher promotional activity and a soft consumer spending environment  Harvey adds to its list of woes  With around 100 stores around Texas  about 9  of its total system   the stock s near term prospects look bleak  As it is  analysts have revised the stock s current quarter and current year earnings downward by 32 5  and 16 1   respectively  over the past two months  Also  the company currently carries a Zacks Rank  5 
Sonic Corp    NASDAQ SONC   is another Zacks Rank  4 company with about 50 locations in Houston itself and more than 960 drive ins around Texas  Per the company s fiscal third quarter conference call  management had already lowered Sonic s same store sales expectation to a negative 2 5  in fiscal 2017 and expects its adjusted EPS to decline in the range of 2 5   Harvey is expected to make matters even worse  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year projects a sales decline of 20 9  from the prior year 
The Cheesecake Factory Inc    NASDAQ CAKE   has nearly 9  of its system exposed to Texas markets and that intensifies its already prevailing problems  The company recently slashed its EPS and comps guidance outlook for fiscal 2017  keeping in mind its low traffic trend  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter and current year earnings have also lowered 12 9  and 7 3   respectively  over the past two months  Cheesecake Factory currently carries a Zacks Rank of 5 
BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI   is another Zacks Rank  5 company with about 18  of its restaurants in Texas  The company already planned to slow down its unit openings in 2017  which is expected to dent sales growth  Moreover  BJRI s current quarter and current year estimates have moved down 7 1  and 11 1   respectively  over the past two months 
Brinker International  Inc  s   NYSE EAT   international comps have already been under pressure due to a slowdown in some of the markets it operates in  The situation at domestic lands has been tight too due to a challenging retail environment in the restaurants space  Now  the company s huge exposure to Texas markets is expected further weigh on its performance  Brinker has a Zacks Rank  4 and its current quarter and current year earnings estimates have moved down 10  and 2 5   respectively  over the past two months 
You can see  
Bottom Line
The amalgamation of consumer spending uncertainty on dining out  Harvey s aftermath and increased labor expenses due to Obamacare is expected to pressurize the restaurant industry in general and the aforementioned stocks in particular 
Although by implementing the right strategies the companies can overcome these hurdles to some extent  it would be prudent for investors to steer clear of these as of now

8626,230141,BJRI,Pizza Hut expanding beer delivery test in Arizona and California,news,"LOS ANGELES  Reuters    Yum Brands Inc s  N YUM  Pizza Hut chain is expanding a beer delivery test to nearly 100 restaurants in Arizona and California this month as industry leaders vie for market share in the face of sluggish growth 
Operators are seeking creative ways to boost sales as restaurant traffic growth has been weak to flat for several years due to competition ranging from grocery stores that sell prepared food to a proliferation of meal kit companies 
Pizza Hut started its beer delivery project in downtown Phoenix in December as part of a larger push to set the chain apart from rivals like Domino s Pizza Inc  N DPZ  
Domino s does not deliver alcohol  but it recently added 150 000 new delivery  hotspots  at U S  parks  beaches and other destinations that do not have traditional addresses in a bid find new business 
The enlarged Pizza Hut test will include Arizona cities such as Tucson  Prescott and Winslow  California cities include Los Angeles  Bakersfield  Sacramento and Santa Barbara 
More than 1 700 of Pizza Hut s roughly 6 300 U S  units have liquor licenses  giving the chain a potential lead over some rivals 
 Many Pizza Hut restaurants are already licensed to serve and distribute beer  without third party services  additional fees  or extended wait times   Pizza Hut Chief Marketing Officer Zipporah Allen told Reuters 
Pizza Hut s beer delivery drivers will be at least 21 years old and trained in local alcohol laws  the company said  They have the authority to cancel a beer delivery order if customers cannot verify they are old enough to legally consume alcohol 
Pizza Hut s announcement landed hours after privately held Panera Bread  NASDAQ PNRA  Co said it had completed the national roll out of its own food delivery service to 897 cities 
While pizza chains and Panera do their own delivery  many other restaurants farm the work out to companies that take a slice of revenue 
Strategy firm Pentallect Inc has forecast that U S  third party food delivery industry sales will grow from  13 billion in 2017 to  24 5 billion by 2022 
Pizza Hut parent Yum  which also owns the Taco Bell and KFC brands  earlier this year spent  200 million to buy a 3 percent stake in food delivery company GrubHub Inc  N GRUB  
McDonald s Corp  N MCD  partners with UberEats for fast food delivery in the United States

8628,230143,RS,Stockbeat   U S  Steel Jumps Despite Goldman Warning Low Prices Signal Pain Ahead,news,"Investing com   United States Steel rallied on Tuesday despite Goldman Sachs downgrading the company and warning that the backdrop for the steel industry is flimsy amid  materially  lower steel prices 
United States Steel  NYSE X  was up 4 8   shrugging off the downgrade amid a broader based rally in markets as expectation for an interest rate cut after Federal Reserve Chairman Powell said the central bank would  act as appropriate  to support the domestic economy 
Goldman Sachs downgraded U S  Steel to sell from neutral  The investment house also cut its price target on the stock to  11 from  17  warning lower steel prices will lead to further earnings cuts and possibly hurt the company s bloated balance sheet  U S  Steel hit a 52 week low of  11 67 on Friday  The Goldman downgrade is fairly aggressive  The consensus target of analysts polled by Investing com is still  18 15

 Weakening demand crossed with stubbornly high output from domestic mills has dragged steel sheet prices down to their lowest levels since 2016  and recent moves by the Trump Administration to weaken the Section 232 tariffs have contributed to expectations of ample available supply in the U S  market   said Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Korn 
President Donald Trump said last month the U S  would lift steel and aluminium tariffs on Canada and Mexico  But also left the door open to reimpose the tariffs if the two nations failed to curb any surge of metals imports beyond historical levels

expected performance for second quarter 2017  The company reported core funds from operations   FFO   per share of  2 97 for the quarter  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 92  Core FFO per share also improved 8 4  from the year ago quarter figure of  2 74 Results reflect solid growth in revenues  The company has also raised its outlook for full year 2017 Total revenue of  339 1 million in the quarter exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  336 2 million and was up 5 4  year over year Per the management  during the second quarter  the market environment was  more favorable than expected   especially in Seattle and Northern California  This was partly due to the delay in the delivery of new apartments  However   periodic disruption from large concessions  is expected to continue when a number of  competing apartment communities are simultaneously in lease up within the same submarket   Amid this  for the next few years  management anticipates rental growth in core coastal markets to  trend near long term averages  Essex Property Trust  Inc  Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise    Note  The EPS numbers presented in the above chart represent funds from operations   FFO   per share Quarter in DetailDuring the quarter  Essex Property s same property gross revenues grew 3 9  from the prior year quarter  while same  property net operating income  NOI  improved 4 7  year over year  Financial occupancies of 96 4  expanded 40 basis points  bps  year over year Essex Property exited second quarter 2017 with cash and cash equivalents  including restricted  of  199 9 million  up from  170 3 million at the end of 2016  As of Jul 24  2017  the company had  1 025 billion in undrawn capacity on its unsecured credit facilities During the second quarter  the company issued 311 873 shares of common stock through its equity distribution program at an average price of  260 30  This helped in the generation of net proceeds of  80 6 million OutlookEssex Property

uptick of 10 bps at the mid point  Same property NOI is now guided in the band of 3 3 4 6  from the previous range of 2 8 4 6   marking a 30 bps expansion to the mid point For third quarter 2017  the

performance of Essex Property in the reported quarter  With a strong property base and solid balance sheet  it is likely to leverage on favorable demographic trends in its markets  The company s substantial exposure to the West Coast market  which is home to several innovation and technology companies  offers ample scope to boost its top line over the long term However  elevated apartment deliveries remain a concern  This results in aggressive rental concessions and moderate pricing power of landlords  In fact  such situations are expected to periodically disrupt the company s earnings

8637,230152,BJRI,Here s Why You Should Steer Clear Of BJ s Restaurants Stock,opinion,Shares of BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI   have declined 17 8  year to date  substantially underperforming 5 7  growth of the  it belongs to Moreover  this Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  company has been witnessing downward estimate revisions of late  reflecting analysts  pessimism on its growth prospects Over the last 60 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for BJ s Restaurants  current quarter earnings has slumped 31 6   reflecting eight downward revisions versus none upward  Also  its current year earnings estimates have moved down 11 1   due to eight downward revisions versus no upward revision This apart  BJ s Restaurants has a number of other aspects that make it an unattractive investment option at this point Lackluster Earnings GrowthBJ s Restaurants has historical  3 5 years  earnings per share  EPS  growth rate of negative 7 3  compared with the industry s average of 5 7   Investors should however really focus on its projected growth  Here  the company s EPS is estimated to witness a decline of 14 7  year over year  comparing unfavorably with the industry average  which calls for EPS growth of 3 9 Notably  earnings growth is often an indication of strong prospects  and stock price gains  ahead for the company in question and is thus one of the most important factors to consider  Evidently  BJ s Restaurants falls weak on this front according to current assessments Industry HeadwindsThe U S  restaurant space has not been too enticing for the last few quarters  Despite economic growth  somewhat lower energy prices and higher income  consumers increased their spending only modestly on dining out that resulted in low consumption  This is because along with wage growth  inflation is also on the rise that translates to lower real income  and in turn less disposable income  In fact  the situation has taken a worse turn  thanks to higher health care costs and tightened credit availability in the country Moreover  as consumers demand high quality products at lower prices  it is pushing grocery stores to decrease their food prices in order to remain competitive  This  in turn  is resulting in a bigger gap between food at home and food away from home indices Consequently  same store sales growth has been dull in a difficult sales environment  Traffic too has been weak  In fact  the second quarter of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter of negative comp sales for the restaurant industry as a whole  thereby continuing the somber mood  BJ s Restaurants is no exception to the trend and resultantly  the company s sales have also come under pressure Slowdown in OpeningsIt is to be noted that BJ s Restaurants has reduced the number of planned restaurant openings to 10 in 2017 compared with 17 in the last year  The reduction came on the back of the company s continued belief that the sales headwinds in the industry call for greater focus on traffic and sales building initiatives  However  the slowdown in company s 2017 development plan may dent sales growth Rising Costs Putting Pressure on MarginsHigher cost of sales and labor costs due to higher wages are expected to continue keeping profits under pressure  Also  costs incurred owing to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act would dampen profits Moreover  pre opening costs  higher marketing expenses as well as costs related to sales boosting initiatives might further pressurize margins  Particularly  additional training on slow roasting ovens and handheld tablets will add to the labor costs Meanwhile  BJ s Restaurants has recorded trailing 12 month net margin of just 3 8  compared with the industry average of 15 1   Given the continual rise in expenses  the trend is not expected to reverse for the company any time soon Stocks to ConsiderA few better ranked stocks in this sector are Papa John s International  Inc    NASDAQ PZZA    Domino s Pizza  Inc    NYSE

8655,230170,BJRI,Is BJ s Restaurants  BJRI  A Suitable Value Pick At The Moment ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  BJ s Restaurants has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 20 49  This level compares similarly with the market at large  as the PE ratio for the S P 500 comes in at about 20 48 If we focus on the long term trend of the stock the current level puts BJ s Restaurants  current PE near its lows  The current PE is well below its median for the term  which stands at 29 74   and the number has been on a general downtrend since its peak in 2014  Hence  we could infer that the stock is undervalued in this respect  especially in light of its historical trend  Thus  the present level seems to be a suitable entry point for the stock from a PE perspective Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified Retail   Restaurants industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 27 17  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that BJ s Restaurants has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 22 07  higher than the current figure  Delving deeper into the PE s inputs we observed that the company s earnings are expected to see a slight dip this year  which would serve to inflate the PE ratio  A soft consumer spending environment in the U S  restaurant space has been hurting BJ s Restaurants comps growth and putting sales under pressure  In fact  most restaurateurs have been experiencing a similar fate  However  earnings are expected to stabilize 2018 onwards  PS RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  BJ s Restaurants has a P S ratio of about 0 83  This is significantly lower than the Zacks categorized Retail   Restaurants industry average  which comes in at 3 63 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years This clearly suggests some level of undervalued trading for BJRI at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  BJ s Restaurants currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of  A   putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes BJ s Restaurants a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for BJ s Restaurants is just 1 25  a level that is lower than the industry average of 1 77  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 6 33  which is far better than the industry average of 9 80  Clearly  BJRI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though BJ s Restaurants might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of  A  and a Momentum score of  B   This gives BJRI a Zacks VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of  A    You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value  growth  and momentum characteristics  and a good VGM score can increase your odds of success  All things considered  BJ s Restaurants seems to have pretty striking prospects Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best  The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower  while the full year estimate has seen four upward revisions and two downward revisions in the same time period This has had just a small but meaningful impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has declined 5 5  in the past two months  while the full year estimate has moved higher by 2 9   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below BJ s Restaurants  Inc  Price and Consensus   The combination of these somewhat mixed factors is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBJ s Restaurants is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Although boasting of a strong industry rank  Top 39  out of more than 250 industries   the company s Zacks Rank  3 somewhat dims the sparkle Notably  the restaurant industry has been experiencing low consumption over the last few quarters as consumer discretionary spending in this space has been pretty sluggish  In addition  high labor costs as well as the company s investments in several initiatives have been weighing on margins Nevertheless  in order to navigate through the challenging macro environment  the company has implemented four major sales building initiatives in 2017  which have been tested over the past year  Increased focus on technology driven initiatives  like digital ordering  should also boost sales  Additionally  a deep pipeline of new menu items  loyalty program enhancements and other productivity initiatives are likely to further drive performance So  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn bullish in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick Zacks  Hidden TradesWhile we share many recommendations and ideas with the public  certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services  Would you like

8665,230180,AVB,4 REIT Plays With Beat Potential In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Huge profits and earnings surprises can lure you this earnings season  But rather than accumulating stocks later  investing in those that are yet to release their numbers and poised to beat expectations can fetch you more gains  This is because an earnings beat essentially serves as a catalyst and raises investors  confidence in a stock  This leads to rapid price appreciation  ensuring more gains from one s investments Furthermore  buying an undervalued earnings play should translate into great returns when the stock eventually trades at a higher price  This brings us to the REIT industry  which has gained just 2 2  year to date compared with the S P 500 s return of 10  Admittedly  rate hike and cautious approach of investors have deterred gains from this industry so far this year  However  rather than entirely focusing on the rate factor  investors need to keep in mind that the operating performance of this special hybrid asset is highly determined by the dynamics of the individual asset categories  And a number of asset categories displayed strength in second quarter 2017  with the economy and the job market showing signs of recovery Take for example the industrial and office asset categories which hogged the limelight for experiencing high demand  Going by numbers  per a  by the commercial real estate services  firm   CBRE Group Inc   NYSE CBG    the overall U S  industrial real estate market remained upbeat in the second quarter  with the industrial availability rate declining 10 basis points to 7 8  This not only marked the market s 27th decline in the past 28 quarters  but also the lowest level since first quarter 2001  Obviously  recovering economy and job market gains aided this improvement  but specifically  e commerce boom and a healthy manufacturing environment were the chief drivers  Also  lower than expected completions of construction kept a check on the supply numbers In addition  the U S  office vacancy rate  at 13  in the second quarter amid a balanced demand supply environment  In around half of the U S  office markets  vacancy recorded a decline and the national office vacancy rate is hovering close to its post recession low Moreover  with growth in cloud computing  Internet of Things and big data  and an increasing number of companies opting for third party IT infrastructure  data center REITs are experiencing a boom market  In fact  demand has been outpacing supply in top tier data center markets  Despite enjoying high occupancy  these markets are absorbing new construction at a faster pace Additionally  defying concerns about supply in the market  the residential real estate market is back with a bang driven by robust demand levels  Per a  by the real estate technology and analytics firm  RealPage  Inc   RP   the second quarter demand level of 175 645 apartments across the nation marked one third increase from the level witnessed a year ago  This helped occupancy to remain high at 95 0  as of mid year and led to stabilization in the annual pace of rent growth  which came in at 3 6   close to 3 7  growth experienced in the first quarter  Notably  job formation and checked move outs for buying homes acted as the catalyst    The Zacks MethodologyHowever  not all REITs are equally poised to excel  In fact  despite the drivers  choosing the right stock could be quite difficult unless one knows the proper method  To make the task simple  we rely on the Zacks methodology  which takes into account a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive

Logitech International  NASDAQ LOGI  had a fantastic day on Wednesday  up 3 72  or 17   to 25 22  on 4 3 million shares traded  The base broke out with a breakaway gap  then ran up and flagged  popped at resistance  pulled back and tested  and then had a big pop on Wednesday  I expect it to get to 28  Typically  when you see a stock move like this it will have a much bigger move coming  It s the highest it s been since 2008  and wouldn t shock me if it made a run to the 31 32 zone  Let s keep close tabs on this one 
Unisys Corporation  NYSE UIS  had a big day on Wednesday  up 1 79  or 20   to 10 74  on 4 million shares traded  on a very strong earnings report  With only 20 days to cover  it popped and actually closed  and filled the gap  That may be why there was some difficulty at the end of the day punching through 10 75  If it does follow through  we could see 12  and have a swing on this one for 12 and 14 
Stocks on the Short Side  
Chipotle Mexican Grill  Inc   NYSE CMG  had a big breakdown  and got smacked almost 40 points on Wednesday  down 37 65  or 9   to 368 02  on 6 million shares traded  The consolidation range for the last 90 days was broken on over 6 million shares  Looking at the weekly chart  it broke the entire support zone and may very well test support around 350 1  Look for another 10 points down  and that should get this stock near mid channel  closer to 335  That wouldn t shock me 
DexCom Inc  NASDAQ DXCM  appears to be rolling over  down 2 89  or 3 6   to 77 33  on 1 3 million shares traded on Wednesday  It has a falling wedge  which is a bearish flag  it broke on Wednesday  and was down as much as five dollars  closing down 2 97  It sure broke hard on Wednesday  I could see this taking out support and testing 70

8672,230187,AVB,Can AvalonBay  AVB  Pull Off A Surprise In Q1 Earnings ,opinion,AvalonBay Communities  Inc    NYSE AVB   is slated to report first quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Apr 26 Last quarter  this Arlington  VA based  residential real estate investment trust   REIT   delivered a positive surprise of 0 95   Growth in net operating income  NOI  from newly developed and existing operating communities attributed to this increase  However  this benefit was partly offset by a rise in interest expense Over the trailing four quarters  the company surpassed estimates in two quarters  however missed in the other two occasions  This resulted in an average negative surprise of 0 35   The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company  AvalonBay Communities  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise    Let s see how things have shaped up for this announcement Why a Likely Positive Surprise Our proven model shows that AvalonBay is likely to beat on estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients  A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or at least 3  Hold  to beat estimates  and AvalonBay has the right mix You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our   Zacks ESP  The Earnings ESP  which represents the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate of  2 12 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 11  is  0 47   This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise Zacks Rank  AvalonBay s Zacks Rank  3  when combined with a positive ESP  makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise this season Conversely  we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions What s Driving the Better than Expected Earnings AvalonBay is well poised to grow on the back of a rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics  Moreover  increasing consumer confidence  on the back of job growth  rising wages and a healthier balance sheet  promise strong prospects for the company Notably  in Mar 2017  AvalonBay declared an uptick in its rental revenue outlook for first quarter 2017  Specifically  the company had estimated first quarter 2017 total rental revenue for established communities to grow 3 1 3 2  over the prior year period  At the midpoint  this denoted an expansion of around 25 basis points from the figure projected earlier when the company issued the full year rental revenue growth outlook for established communities on Feb 1 Admittedly  completion of a number of projects in its markets  leading to higher supply  is a concern as elevated supply usually leads to lesser absorption  curtails the landlord s capability to demand more rents and results in a rise in concession activity  However  amid this  increase in rental revenue outlook is encouraging  and reaffirms the company s fundamental strength and stability During the fourth quarter 2016 earnings release  the company revealed its funds from operations  FFO  per share guidance for first quarter 2017  AvalonBay estimated FFO per share in the range of  2 09  2 15 and core FFO per share in the band of  2 06  2 12 In addition  over the past three months  shares of AvalonBay outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry  While AvalonBay logged in a gain of 7 7   the industry climbed 3 9  over this period However  over the past seven days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first quarter FFO per share fell 0 5  to 2 11 Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider  as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this

8690,230205,AVB,Analyst Reports For AT T  Pfizer   General Mills,opinion,"Tuesday  October 25  2016
Today s Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks  including AT T  NYSE T   General Mills  NYSE GIS  and Pfizer  NYSE PFE  
AT T is in the headlines because of the Time Warner  TWX  deal  which will likely get plenty of regulatory scrutiny  The stock had lost ground prior to the deal announcement as the market s earlier affinity big dividend paying telecom stocks had cooled off to some extent  That said  it is still up more than 7  year to date  doing better than both Verizon as well as the broader S P 500 index  AT T s Q3 results were mixed  though the strategic rationale for the Time Warner deal is compelling   You can 
General Mills shares have not been doing too well lately  likely reflecting weakness in the company s U S  Retail segment as a result of lower demand amid changing consumer food preferences  But the analyst likes its robust restructuring savings  which are making up for the slower revenue growth  Though consumer focused innovation and marketing drive as well as greater distribution of natural and organic portfolio helped improve the top line on many businesses in segments like cereals and snacks in fiscal 2016  a material improvement may take time   You can  
Pfizer shares have lagged the market this year  in line with the broader the pharmaceutical space  on concerns about the group s pricing power in the current political environment  These issues notwithstanding  the analyst likes Pfizer s strategy of strengthening its product portfolio and pipeline through acquisitions and licensing deals  The 2015 Hospira acquisition has significantly expanded Pfizer s sterile injectable and biosimilar capabilities  However  headwinds remain in the form of genericization and the expiration of a few co promotion agreements which will continue to hamper top line growth  Estimate movement has been mixed lately ahead of the company s Q3 earnings release   You can

8699,230214,BJRI,What s In Store For BJ s Restaurants  BJRI  In Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"BJ s Restaurants  Inc   NASDAQ BJRI   is set to report second quarter 2016 results on Jul 26 
Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 17 5   In fact  the company delivered positive surprises in all the last four quarters  bringing the average surprise to 18 52  
Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement BJ S RESTAURANT Price and EPS Surprise   Factors to Consider
The company s Project Q initiative  which reduced average kitchen hours leading to labor efficiencies  have led to strong margins in the past few quarters and are expected to continue to do so in the to be reported quarter  The company is also committed to raise its operating margins through cost containment initiatives 
Moreover  menu innovation  trimming down of complicated menus  prudent expansion initiatives  and aggressive marketing and operational strategies have remained strong points for the company in the past and are expected to continue to boost sales in the second quarter  Also  the company s investments in technology driven initiatives like digital ordering should add to sales 
However  higher cost of sales and labor costs due to higher wages are expected to keep profits under pressure 
Earnings Whispers 
Our proven model does not conclusively show that BJ s Restaurants is likely to beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Earnings ESP for BJ s Restaurants is 0 00  as both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 57 cents per share 
Zacks Rank  BJ s Restaurants carries a Zacks Rank  3  which when combined with an ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 and  5  Sell rated stocks  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Stocks in the restaurant space that have both a positive earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank and are therefore worth considering include

8701,230216,BJRI,Soft Restaurant Earnings May Take A Bite Out Of This ETF,opinion,"The restaurant industry has fallen out of favor recently as evident by the Zacks industry rank which is in the bottom 39  segment currently  While the gradual rebound in the U S  economy and lower energy spending continue to favor consumer spending and should therefore act as tailwinds to the restaurants business  wage growth and  are serious headwinds to the business  read    
For a clearer picture of the sector  let s take a closer look at some of the recent earnings releases  read       
McDonald s Corp    NYSE MCD   reported a mixed bag Q2 on July 26 after market close  Its earnings of  1 45 per share  adjusted for strategic charges  came ahead of the Zacks Consensus estimate of  1 38  Barring the effect of strategic charges and prior year restructuring charges of  0 04 per share  diluted earnings per share grew 13  in constant currencies  as per  
Its revenues of  6 265 billion fell 4  year over year mainly due to currency headwinds  In constant currency  the figure declined 1   Revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  6 281 billion  Its global comparable sales rose 3 1   with positive comps noted in all segments  However  comps came   Shares fell about 4 5  on July 26  managing to add over 0 1  after hours 
Panera Bread Co   NASDAQ PNRA   beat on both lines and impressed investors on July 26 after market close  Its earnings of  1 78 per share were up 11  year over year and beat estimate by 3 cents while revenues of  698 9 million  up 3  year over year  beat the estimate by a whisker  Company owned comparable net bakery cafe sales rose 4 2  in Q2  Also  the mid point ofthe 2016 non GAAP earnings per share guided range   Shares advanced about 3 9  after hours on July 26 
Buffalo Wild Wings   NASDAQ BWLD   posted mixed Q2 results  Its earnings of  1 27 per share  up 13 4  year over year  beat Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny but its revenues of  490 2 million grew 15  year over year  Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  502 million  However  BWLD shares were up over 5 3  after hours on news that activist investment firm  has taken a bigger stake in the sports themed restaurant chain 
BJ s Restaurants Inc    NASDAQ BJRI   also reported on July 26 and depressed investors by missing on both lines  Earnings missed by a penny while revenues fell short by 1 2   Shares were down 2 7  after hours 
Apart from these recent reporters Yum  Brands Inc    NYSE YUM   came up with mixed results and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc    NYSE CMG   missed on both lines  All in all  the operating backdrop of the sector is definitely not upbeat 
Tough Time Ahead for Restaurant ETF 
If somber earnings are not enough to scare you   on plenty of restaurant stocks may do that  Lately  Stifel Nicolaus and Jefferies tapered their outlook on several restaurant stocks  Jefferies believes that the  industry has at least 18 months of challenges ahead  given weaker comps and increasing labor costs  On the other hand  Stifel got   on restaurants and adopted an industry wide recession outlook  
Moreover  McDonald s management noted that food at home inflation is likely to be flat to up about 1  for this year  which is considerably lower than food away from home inflation which is expected to be up 2 5  to 3 5   Naturally  such a wide difference in prices may discourage guests from eating out frequently 
All these developments put the pure play ETF on the restaurant industry   Restaurant ETF    in focus  The fund may slip in the days to come on slowly mounting pressure  see

8707,230222,IPGP,5 Better Tech Picks If You Don t Like Facebook Now,opinion,Spooked by the data breach news  social media giant Facebook   NASDAQ FB   was one of the worst performing stocks on Wall

market Both the S P technology index and tech heavy Nasdaq Composite Index witnessed the worst one day fall since the selloff in early February  declining 2 1  and 2 5   respectively What Happened The steep decline came following reports from New York Times and London s Observer  which revealed that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica  which had ties to the Trump campaign  gained inappropriate access to data on more than 50 million Facebook users  This has sparked broader concerns about data privacy and security  and will likely lead to increased scrutiny over data security and a relatively heavy regulatory pressure As such  shares of Facebook tumbled 6 8  in Monday s trading session  representing the worst one day drop in nearly four years  and wiped out  36 4 billion from the company s market value  With the slide  the stock is down 11 6  from the latest peak  signaling that it has entered correction territory Facebook currently has a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and a Growth Score of B

 VR headsets  drones  virtual reality  and artificial intelligence as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as the key catalysts Additionally  the twin tailwinds of Trump s tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are pushing the stocks higher  Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are giving a solid boost to economically sensitive growth

	Chipotle s performance has been largely damaged by the food safety issues it has faced in the recent past 


		CHIPOTLE MEXICAN Price



   


	The restaurant chain has been reeling under the negative publicity related to the E  coli outbreak  which began in Oregon and Washington at the end of last October and later spread to 12 states  Also  in Dec 2015  a norovirus outburst at a Chipotle outlet in Boston s Cleveland Circle affected around 136 diners  including 30 students of Boston College 
	Meanwhile  though the negative media hype cannot be ignored  the fact that Chipotle is forced to pull shutters down on a store as soon as it is reopened has been very damaging  This is largely because of contaminated food and the continuing effect of the E  coli outbreak 
	Meanwhile other restaurants have been working on providing customers with healthier food and innovative menu options in the fast casual restaurant space  intensifying competition for Chipotle 
	Notably  Qdoba rolled out a new taco menu last year while Taco Bell has been doing well  especially in the U S   over the past few quarters on the back of strong sales in the breakfast category  Moe s Southwest Grill has also gained popularity on the back of its build your own tacos  quesadillas and burrito bowls  Chipotle  on the other hand  lags behind on the menu innovation front   Our Take
	The fact that Chipotle has been using healthy ingredients has been its marketing strength despite the high prices  With food safety issues still looming large  Chipotle has its back to the wall 
	Though the company is leaving no stone unturned to gain back customers through the adoption of new food safety protocols  offers for free burritos  buy one get one deals and a few menu innovations  it will take some time for the fast casual restaurant operator to witness a turnaround in its business

safe havens for investors in the first half of 2016  Further  with more people choosing to dine out these days  it is needless to say that the restaurant industry is poised to rake in more returns going ahead What s Driving the Restaurant Stocks   The U S  restaurant industry gained momentum at the start of 2016 on the back of improving consumer spending patterns  which in turn were positively

8755,230270,BJRI,Sunshine Appears As Equities Post Strong Gains,opinion," Optimism is a happiness magnet  If you stay positive  good things and good people will be drawn to you   Mary Lou Retton

The world can be a downright difficult place  so much so one can be forgiven if they get down once in a while  Going a step further  there are plenty of people in the world who always are  to put it kindly  a bit difficult  Generally I try and minimize contact with these individuals as much as possible  but there are some days when you are booked solid with dour Dans  As it relates to the investment world  it seems the general consensus among participants is to adopt a generally pessimistic attitude about what the rest of 2016 has in store for markets  After the first month and a half  you could understand why  as it was the worst period for stocks in quite a long time  down 10  in most major markets 
If you look at the last twenty years for investors in domestic markets  they have experienced the internet bubble and crash  the accounting frauds at Enron and WorldCom  Bernie Madoff  the housing boom and bust  Lehman  American International Group Inc  N AIG   Washington Mutual  and the unprecedented government intervention to save markets from what may have been a situation more dangerous than the Great Depression  It is understandable why placing hard earned dollars into the stock market is now viewed as  at the very least  an activity to be skeptical about  The apprehension and negative market psychology remains the overriding obstacle for equity investors  probably now more than ever 
Still  this week the market showed signs of getting off the floor as a good retail sales number last Friday  a rebound in oil as Russia  Iran and Venezuela negotiated production caps  and some bargain hunting all helped the cause  The last six months have been a trying period but it has provided an opportunity to purchase top notch companies at far better prices  If you are long term investor  you are probably grinning ear to ear  It seems Mary Lou Retton  quite the accomplished gymnast  knew a thing or too about investing as well 
There were a ton of individual companies which reported earnings this week  In the retail sector  the head honcho remains Wal Mart  which saw flat revenue and same store sales figures on Wednesday  They still earned nearly  5 billion for the quarter  Nordson Corporation  O NDSN   a high quality department store group  also missed estimates with sales store sales falling over 3   In the tech universe  NVIDIA Corporation  O NVDA  posted a good number  earning  35 cents versus   32 expected  Dining concerns Restaurant Brands  BJs Restaurants Inc  O BJRI   and The Cheesecake Factory  O CAKE  beat estimates as Burger King  Tim Horton s  pizza  and a good piece of cake remain time tested money makers  Next week  plenty more report including Target Corporation  N TGT   Fitbit Inc  N FIT   Home Depot  N HD   and Macy s Inc  N M   Stay tuned

Why the Upgrade  On Oct 23  BJ s Restaurants Inc  s third quarter 2014 earnings of 23 cents per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the prior year figure of 13 cents by 76 9   Revenues in the reported quarter also grew 9 7  year over year to  206 5 million  due to comps growth  However  revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  208 0 million by a meager 0 9     Comps in the quarter increased 0 3   which compared favorably with a decline of 2 2  in the prior year quarter  This was primarily due to a 0 7  increase in guest counts  partially offset by a lower average check  Restaurant level margins were 17 6   up 130 basis points year over year  mainly due to the higher year over year sales combined with the cost containment and Project Q initiatives  which focused on improving kitchen productivity while enhancing food quality  Further  we are also encouraged by the company s decision to launch its smaller prototype restaurants  which requires lower investments  in various markets  BJ s Restaurants is steadily moving towards its target of opening 11 new restaurants  based on the new restaurant design  in 2014  Till date the company has opened 10 restaurants  with the last opening scheduled to take place next week Fort Myers  Florida  In our view  with commodity costs staying at an all time high  lower investment by the company will be beneficial to its margins  And the fact that the company is focusing on its expansion plans without sacrificing margins is laudable  In fact  we believe the smaller prototype restaurant will be the primary driver for the company s long term goal of a restaurant level margin of 19  Other Stocks to Consider The following companies with a favorable Zacks Rank that are worth considering include DineEquity  Inc   NYSE DIN   Ruby Tuesday  Inc   NYSE RT  and Domino s Pizza  Inc   NYSE DPZ   While DineEquity and Ruby Tuesday carry the same Zacks Rank as BJ s Restaurants  Domino s Pizza sports a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  ",2014-11-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/bj's-restaurants-upped-to-strong-buy-on-strong-q3-earnings-232627,232627
8760,230275,BJRI,3 Hot Sector Stocks For This Earnings Season,opinion,"The fourth quarter earnings season not only looks weak  but is also stuck in a web of global political and economic woes  The acceleration seen in economic growth is limited only to the U S  as global growth is clearly in jeopardy  Both the S P 500 and Dow Jones have lately been in the red  losing 1 9  and 1 7   respectively  year to date 
 This is especially true as oil price is not showing any sign of a rebound  speculations of Greece departing from Eurozone are rife  and the Swiss bank surprisingly abandoned its currency cap spreading jitters across the globe  Further  sluggish data from China  global economic growth concerns and hopes of a big stimulus from European Central Bank  ECB  have kept the market highly volatile  In such a backdrop  investors could definitely take advantage of the beaten down stock prices to profit from the Q4 earnings season and may look to the sectors that are grabbing attention in 2015  Here  we focus on three hot sectors  industrial products  retail and  of course  energy  All these have lately taken a hit and are thus cheaper than many other sectors  The stocks in these popular sectors are also expected to post stronger earnings in Q4  Zeroing in on the stocks of these in focus sectors that have a high chance of surprising in their upcoming release and have seen their prices sliding lately would therefore be a good idea to play this earnings season How to Choose Stocks  Earnings beat will definitely inspire investor confidence and propel the price of these sector stocks higher  Picking the star performers would be easy if we go by our proprietary methodology that selects stocks with a combination of a favorable Zacks Rank   Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  or 3  Hold    and a positive   Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have the maximum chance to surprise with their upcoming earnings announcements  It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Our research shows that for stocks with this combination  the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70   Below  we have highlighted three beaten down stocks from the hottest sectors that will likely deliver an earnings beat when their results are released in the coming weeks  The outperformance would drive the share price higher  resulting in above market returns Industrial Products

Driven by higher same store sales and a continued optimistic outlook for future business conditions  the Restaurant Performance Index in March was above 100 for the 25th consecutive month  the Current Situation Index was above 100 for the 13th consecutive month  and the Expectations Index was above 100 for the 29th consecutive month  Meanwhile  with severe winter weather conditions subsiding  restaurant sales rebounded in April  which possibly signals better second quarter results  Per TDn2K s Black Box Intelligence  same store sales rose 1 9  in April  Given the positive factors  the restaurant industry is expected to generate sales of more than  709 0 billion in 2015    marking the sixth consecutive year of real  inflation adjusted  sales growth for the industry  However  the growth rate is quite modest owing to a still constrained consumer spending environment  Despite moderate improvement in economic growth  consumers are increasing their spending slightly as they are busy saving  This is reflected in traffic trends that have not shown much improvement  Meanwhile  a fluctuating consumer confidence index reflects uncertainty  Additionally  rising food and labor costs and currency rates remain headwinds  Nevertheless  per market analysts  the overall industry is relatively well positioned compared to the past years

8764,230279,BJRI,3 Retail Growth Stocks To Kick Start Q2 Earnings Season,opinion,"It is time to rejuvenate your portfolio once again  as we gradually head toward second quarter earnings season  Nonetheless  the unpredictability which is so characteristic of the market continues to haunt every investor  Things have not changed much from the first quarter which was defined by a strong dollar  weakness in the energy sector and global growth issues 
However  a little groundwork will definitely give a fair idea that the economy isn t in such a bad shape as was perceived when the  second estimate  released by the Commerce Department revealed that GDP shrank 0 7  in first quarter 2015   harsh winter weather  strikes at Western Coast ports  a stronger dollar hampering exports  and decline in business investment were cited as the reasons behind the meltdown 
Instead  gradual recovery in the housing market  the strengthening manufacturing sector  an improving labor market and lower gasoline prices are favoring the economy  Moreover  progress related to Greece s debt deal may also support growth  Industry analysts predict that the encouraging economic data will be reflected in interest rate hike sometime later in the year  However  they are keeping their fingers crossed regarding markets  reactions 
Coming to numbers  recent data shows that unemployment claims dropped by 12 000 for the week ended Jun 13  to a seasonally adjusted 267 000 versus the consensus estimate of 276 500  while the unemployment rate is hovering around 5 5   Consumer confidence   a key determinant of financial health   is also improving  making the future look brighter  In fact  the preliminary data released by the University of Michigan highlighted that the consumer sentiment index has jumped to 94 6 in June from the May reading of 90 7 
However  despite a convincing economic recovery  consumer spending remained flat in April  following a 0 5  increase in March  Consumer spending  which accounts for over two thirds of the U S  economic activity  decelerated to a rate of 1 8  in first quarter 2015 from 4 4  in fourth quarter 2014 
It is quite apparent that market sentiment is influenced by a number of events  Well  now there are two choices    either be a spectator and wait for a convincing economic climate  or be a front runner by identifying stocks that have the potential to outperform even when market conditions are not congenial  However  it might be difficult for one to look at each parameter and compare with the peer group for an analysis on whether the stock is attractive from the growth perspective 
To make the task easy  Zacks has designed the new Style Score System  The attractiveness of a stock as an investment option is confirmed by its Growth Style Score of  A   or  B    The Growth Style Score combines conventional growth metrics with a thorough analysis of the company s income statement  balance sheet and statements of cash flows to evaluate its financial health and the sustainability of its growth trajectory  Our research shows that stocks with Growth Style Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or  2  Buy  offer the best upside potential 
3 Retail Growth Picks
We have identified 3 Retail Growth Stocks which have incredible potential in the near term and a positive Zacks Earnings ESP 
We suggest investing in Aarons Inc  NYSE AAN   a specialty retailer of furniture  consumer electronics  computers  appliances  and household accessories  with a Growth Score of  A   This Zacks Rank  1 stock has a long term earnings growth rate of 12   The Atlanta  GA based company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 12 2  over the trailing four quarters  and has an Earnings ESP of  8 70   It is expected to witness earnings growth of 27 5  in 2015 and 16 2  in 2016  The Zacks Consensus Estimate too has moved up over the past 60 days 
Lithia Motors Inc  NYSE LAD  which operates as an automotive franchisee and retailer of new and used vehicles  is another solid bet  with a Growth Score of  B   The stock holds a Zacks Rank  2  and has a long term earnings growth rate of 22 4   Based in Medford  OR  Lithia Motors delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 10 1  over the trailing four quarters  and has an Earnings ESP of  0 61   The company is expected to witness earnings growth of 25  in 2015 and 10 6  in 2016  The Zacks Consensus Estimate too has been portraying an uptrend over the past 60 days 
Another Zacks Rank  2 stock that investors may look forward to is BJs Restaurants Inc  NASDAQ BJRI   with a Growth Score of  A   This operator of casual dining restaurants has an Earnings ESP of  2 56   An average positive earnings surprise of 44 5  over the trailing four quarters and a long term earnings growth rate of 20 2  make this Huntington Beach  CA based company quite an attractive investment option  The company is expected to witness earnings growth of 41 1  in 2015 and 21 2  in 2016  The Zacks Consensus Estimate too has trended upward over the past 60 days 
Bottom Line
Investors can confidently end their search at stocks with a better Zacks Rank status of either  1 or  2  which encompasses its strong fundamentals  promises price movement and highlights analysts  constructive view on the same via positive estimate revisions  A sturdy portfolio always gives favorable returns ",2015-06-23,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/3-retail-growth-stocks-to-kick-start-q2-earnings-season-255895,255895
8765,230280,AVB,A Cheap  High Yielding Apartment REIT,opinion,"I recently discussed one of the most significant problems facing our economy   a massive debt load  The aggregate debt level  relative to economic output  has not materially declined since the apex of the credit expansion in 2008 
To be sure  the situation has improved somewhat  Pockets of deleveraging have occurred 
However  there s one crucial area that s accumulating debt at a frightening pace  Outstanding student loan debt has surged to an astounding  1 26 trillion from  637 billion at the end of 2007 
The   with an average of  33 000 in student loan debt per graduate  This is particularly troublesome because these young adults are the next generation of consumers and homeowners  College graduates are becoming increasingly burdened with student loan payments well into their adult lives 
According to the National Association of Realtors  student loan debt is hampering the household formation process  In a recent survey  among first time buyers who said it was difficult to save for a down payment  54  said student loans made it tough to save money 
The Federal Reserve is even noticing the impact of these trends on the housing market  Below is an excerpt from the latest Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes  emphasis added  
 Despite attractive mortgage rates  housing demand was seen as being damped by such factors as restrictive credit conditions  particularly for households with low credit scores  high down payments  or low demand among younger homebuyers  due in part to the burden of student loan debt  
Whether it s due to student loan debt  stagnant wages  economic hardship  or even personal preferences  homeownership among young adults is in a startling decline 
The homeownership rate in the first quarter of 2014 for Americans 35 and under fell to 36 2   the lowest level since the U S  Census Bureau started tracking home ownership by age in 1982 
But the Millennials have to live somewhere  If they don t own a house   and they aren t living with Mom and Dad   then they re probably renting 
Ultimately  those who own and manage apartment complexes and multifamily communities stand to benefit from a nation of renters 
Cashing in on a Nation of Renters
There s reason to believe that residential real estate investment trusts  REITs  are going to be the beneficiaries of these secular  macro tailwinds 
But as we ve been saying all year  the larger REITs tend to be expensive 
But a small cap REIT  Independence Realty Trust  AMEX IRT   has caught my attention this week 
Independence Realty Trust owns and operates garden style and mid rise apartment properties in Arizona  Colorado  Georgia  Indiana  Texas  and Virginia  The company just priced a secondary offering  or additional issuance of shares   and it intends to use the net proceeds from the offering primarily to acquire additional apartment properties 
In the past week  IRT s stock price has declined from over  10 50 down to around the offering price of  9 50  Secondaries are often good buying opportunities for astute investors  and from an investment standpoint  its valuation is very attractive 
The table below compares IRT with a few of the big boys  Equity Residential  NYSE EQR   AvalonBay Communities  NYSE AVB   and Essex Property Trust  NYSE ESS  

As you can see  IRT is far cheaper than these larger REITs based on its price to 2014 estimated funds from operations  FFO  
The new price to FFO ratio for IRT may change  depending on how much cash flow per dollar the new assets produce relative to the company s existing apartment portfolio 
However  I don t think the firm would be raising funds unless it and the external manager  a wholly owned subsidiary of RAIT Financial Trust  NYSE RAS   are confident that there are attractive acquisition opportunities out there 
Yield starved investors will also love IRT s 7 6  annualized dividend yield  as well as its monthly dividend payout 
Bottom line  Independence Realty Trust is a cheap  high yielding REIT that s positioned to benefit from our nation s shift towards renting

In October  AvalonBay reported encouraging third quarter 2014 results  The company reported third quarter 2014 funds from operations  FFO  of  2 14 per share that came 6 5  ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and jumped 81 4  from the prior year quarter figure  The impressive results were driven by improved performance of its newly developed and acquired communities 
Going forward  increasing consumer confidence backed by job growth  rising wage and healthier balance sheet keep us optimistic about the company s growth prospects  Apart from this  demographic growth continues to be strong in the young adult age cohort  which has a higher propensity to rent and provides a significant source of pent up demand 
Nevertheless  though these positives bode well for the company s future  yet  completion of a number of projects in the Metro DC area and modest job growth keeps the fundamentals of this market challenged 
Over the last 30 days  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 and 2015 FFO per share upped by 15 cents and a penny to  7 28 and  7 41  respectively  The company currently has a Zacks Rank  3  Hold

The Markets 
An unexpected rate cut out of China and hints of stimulus out of Europe were enough to fuel a rally in equity markets around the globe on Friday  The S P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average both gained just over half of one percent  charting a fifth straight weekly gain and maintaining an unprecedented climb from the lows charted in October  The S P 500 Index has now traded above its 5 day moving average for 26 sessions  tied for the longest run above this short term average in over 60 years   This 5 day moving average  at 2051 62 as of Friday s close  remains the line of support below this market  clearly  a catalyst is required to initiate a retracement  alleviating the overbought conditions that have become ubiquitous 



With central banks outside of the US maintaining accommodative policies  the US Dollar Index traded to the highest level in over four years  testing the June high of 88 71  This high marks a level of horizontal resistance that has kept a lid on the US currency since 2006  ahead of the accommodative policies implemented by the US Fed during the recent recession  With the US Fed on a path towards tightening  a breakout in the US Dollar through resistance appears inevitable  A move above resistance would complete a long term basing pattern  suggesting that the strength in the currency index realized since the summer is just the start of a more substantial move in the benchmark that could last for some years  The US Dollar seasonally gains through the first few months of the new year  but  before it enters this period of seasonal strength  it has to get through the weakest month of the year  based on the frequency of losses  Over the past 20 years  the US Dollar Index has declined 70  of the time in the month of December  recording an average loss of 0 80   Given the significant resistance that remains intact around 89  this may be the opportune time for the benchmark to retrace some of its recent gains  testing levels of support below before continuing higher along its long term path 



Of course  a stronger dollar is typically a negative for commodities priced in the domestic currency  From November of 1996 through to July of 1999  the approximately 20  rise in the US Dollar index resulted in a loss for the CRB commodity index of approximately 25   charting the lowest levels in the past 25 years  Just as The US Dollar Index is testing long term resistance  the CRB commodity index is testing long term support around 266  a break of which could set the benchmark up to test the 2010 low at around 250  and then the 2009 low around 200   The CRB Commodity Index remains seasonally negative through to mid December  weighed down by seasonal weakness in energy commodity prices 



Reverting back to the equity market  the strength in benchmarks around the globe on Friday has pushed the German Dax to a pivotal point within its intermediate trend  The benchmark  which is arguably a critical component to the success of the euro zone  is bumping up against declining trendline resistance within an ongoing megaphone pattern  A breakout from present levels would suggest a conclusion to the downward path that has pressured the benchmark since the start of summer  Much of the same can be said of the MSCI EAFE Index  which has been bound by the same pattern over the past four and a half months  Seasonally  the German Dax is entering into the strongest month of the year  gaining in 85  of Decembers over the past 20 years  resulting in an average gain of 2 7   The German Dax has started to show signs of outperformance versus the S P 500 Index  suggesting renewed investor interest 







Sentiment on Friday  as gauged by the put call ratio  ended bullish at 0 75 



 Sectors and Industries entering their period of seasonal strength 







Copper is entering its period of seasonal strength  running through to May  gaining 10   on average  over the period  Although the metal shows mixed tendencies of gains in the last two months of the year  significant lows during this timeframe can often provide appealing entry points for the dominant period of strength through the first few months of the new year  The commodity benefits from a pick up in manufacturing and industrial production leading into the spring months  Looking at a long term chart  copper is presently trading within a massive descending triangle pattern  a bearish setup that would become fulfilled upon a break below support  presently at  3 00  Resistance is currently trending lower around  3 15  As the pattern narrows and price action reaches a peak  a break will become evident  providing confirmation of a bullish or bearish move ahead  Shorter term  the price of Copper is bumping up against resistance at the 50 day moving average  a break of which would conclude an intermediate negative trend that has remained apparent since the summer  Momentum indicators have been trending higher since the start of October  suggesting downside exhaustion  The metal is at a pivotal point  which has just become more interesting with the period of seasonal strength ahead of us

8769,230284,AVB,Are REITs Threatened By Treasury Yields  Rate Hikes ,opinion,The spotlight is once again on bond market behavior  and stocks are scrambling for an indication which way to turn  REITs  which are often treated as bonds because of their high dividend paying nature  are naturally in focus  As such  treasury yields end up playing a significant role in the price movement of REIT stocks    yields of which become less attractive when treasury yields rise  The global bond market has been bustling lately  Last Wednesday  yields on Germany s 10 Year Bunds  German government bonds  crossed the 1  threshold for the first time since September  with deflationary concerns being receded by the recent economic data and anticipations of stabilization in the Euro zone economy  The ripple effect of the European sell off could be felt in the U S  Treasury market where 10 Year yields remained high amid substantial government auctions  Despite anticipations of minor corrections  the yields are further expected to move up with the Fed gearing up for a rate hike in the upcoming months according to the consensus view Impact on Segments Essentially  rising interest rates lead to an increase in interest costs as REITs usually look for both fixed and variable rate debt financing to pay back maturing debt  and fund their acquisitions  development and redevelopment activities  Therefore  REITs cannot practically run away from the impact of rate hikes  But the extent of such an impact would depend on the nature of their leases and funding activities  Take for example the Healthcare REITs that usually have significant exposure to long term leased assets  The long term leases carry fixed rental rates that are subject to annual bumps  But their debt obligations bear floating rates with interest and related payments rates varying with the movement of LIBOR  Bankers  Acceptance or other indexes  Therefore  as the rates rise  the cost of borrowing increases but their revenue flows do not get adjusted quickly for their fixed rate nature  leading to an adverse impact on profitability  Consider Mortgage REITs that offer real estate financing through purchase or origination of mortgages and mortgage backed securities  MBS   These REITs fund their investments with equity and debt capital and earn profits from the spread between interest income on their mortgage assets and their funding costs  Though these types of REITs have started adjusting their strategies and business models  these companies bear long term risk as interest rates will eventually rise  In fact  for the equity REITs that acquire properties such as apartments  shopping malls  office buildings and several other kinds of assets and generate income from renting them out  there are risks besides the interest rate issue  Specific market weakness can also dampen their growth momentum  Among the equity REITs are the Apartment REITs for which elevation in the supply level in certain markets raises an alarm  This is because higher supply usually curtails the landlord s capability to demand more rents and leads to lesser absorption  In fact  the increase in deliveries of new units has already kept industry behemoths like AvalonBay Communities Inc  NYSE AVB  and Equity Residential  NYSE EQR  on their toes  AvalonBay is expected to experience an increase in supply in Seattle and Northern California  Moreover  the D C  region remains a weak market with a reasonable amount of supply coming online  For Equity Residential  new leasing is expected to face tremendous pressure and pricing might be adversely impacted in regions with elevated supply  Markets such as Washington D C   Boston  Brooklyn and Jersey City and South Florida are specific areas of concern  Even for the Hotel Lodging REITs  though supply in the West Coast is low and overall whole fundamentals remain strong  higher supply on the East Coast and overall pricing weakness continue to restrict RevPAR  Revenue Per Available Room  growth in the region  Specific REITs that we don t like with a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  include American Capital Mortgage Investment Corp   NASDAQ MTGE  and Redwood Trust  Inc   NYSE RWT  as well as Zacks Rank  4  Sell  stocks such as Ellington Residential Mortgage REIT  NYSE EARN   DDR Corp   NYSE DDR   Retail Properties of America  Inc   NYSE RPAI   American Homes 4 Rent  ASX AMH   Independence Realty Trust  Inc   NYSE IRT   Gladstone Commercial Corp   NASDAQ GOOD   Terreno Realty Corp   NYSE TRNO  and New York REIT  Inc   NYSE NYRT  Bottom Line Though uncertain markets and a low interest rate environment made defensive and high yielding industries like REITs more attractive in the past  the situation has changed now  REITs are in fact underperforming the broader equity market in recent months amid anticipations of a rate hike and treasury yield issues  While any precise prediction for a rate hike can prove wrong  this does not mean that rates will always remain low  In fact  whenever they do rise  rate sensitive REITs will bear the brunt if the hike is not accompanied by solid economic growth  Despite having many positives  there is no shortage of negative factors  Therefore  investors should satisfy themselves by dispassionately absorbing both sides of the argument and then call the shots ,2015-06-17,Zacks Investment

8772,230287,BJRI,5 Retail Stocks To Buy As Consumer Spending Picks Up,opinion,The Federal Reserve may have just got another solid reason to go for a rate hike when it meets this month  Consumer spending  which accounts for over two thirds of U S  economic activity  witnessed a sharp increase in almost seven years  The Commerce Department unveiled that consumer spending advanced 1  in April better than analysts  expectation of a 0 7  rise and up significantly from a flat reading in March and a 0 2  jump in February Consumers purchased automobiles and other durable goods with renewed vigor  as personal income increased 0 4  and disposable personal income rose 0 5   April stood out as the best month since Aug 2009 with respect to consumer spending  Strong consumer spending is a sheer reflection of the economy gaining momentum which had nearly stalled in the beginning of the year  with a tepid 0 8  growth in the first quarter Market experts remained cautiously optimistic about acceleration in economic growth in the second quarter  On the one hand  they are citing that consumers are likely to spend more supported by rising income  an improving job market and gains in house price  On the other hand  they are not ignoring the fact that consumer confidence dampened somewhat last month  According to the recent Conference Board data  the Consumer Confidence Index dipped to 92 6 in May from April s revised reading of 94 7  and also came in below analysts  projection of 96 0 With an expected rebound in the economy  the retail space is bubbling with optimism  Industry analysts predict that encouraging economic data might reflect in an interest rate hike   a step toward  normalizing monetary policy   Well  the Federal Reserve is surely keeping a close watch on the ongoing economic activities and will arrive at a decision only after taking into account all the relevant factors But for now  how about being a wise investor  Let s look for some retail stocks that could prove to be great additions against the backdrop of higher consumer spending 5 Prominent PicksWe suggest investing in Delta Apparel Inc    NYSE DLA    which flaunts a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   The Greenville  SC based company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 28 5  over the trailing four quarters  This designer  manufacturer and marketer of portfolio of lifestyle

long the improvement will last linger  Market pundits believe that an improving labor market and rising income will surely increase confidence and instigate spending  And if this happens and sustains  it will largely help the economy to emerge strongly  A balanced economy with inflation gradually crawling toward the desired level of 2  may prompt the Fed Chair Janet Yellen to go for a rate hike  In such a market scenario  retail will always be one of the lucrative sectors to invest in ,2016-05-31,Zacks Investment

8786,230301,BJRI,Nordstrom No Longer En Vouge  4 Retail Stocks To Buy Instead,opinion,Investors want their portfolio to have stocks with a track record of better than expected results  surging share price and favorable recommendation  However  Nordstrom Inc    NYSE JWN   has failed to meet any of these criteria and is no longer in investors  good books  Nordstrom remains deeply entrenched in the bearish territory as the stock has lost its value by nearly 28  in the past six months This fashion specialty retailer of apparel  shoes  cosmetics and accessories has been witnessing a downtrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate  Moreover  the company currently carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell   This implies that analysts covering the stock are not hopeful about Nordstrom s performance in the near future Nordstrom Fundamentally WeakNordstrom commenced fiscal 2016 on a downbeat note  continuing with its disappointing performance in the fiscal first quarter  wherein both the top and the bottom lines lagged estimates for the third time in a row  Earnings plunged sharply year over year  bearing the brunt of lower than anticipated sales and soft margins that stemmed from higher markdowns so as to efficiently align inventory with the existing trends  These factors also led the company to lower its earnings and sales projections for fiscal 2016  A competitive retail landscape and consumers  cautionary approach while purchasing discretionary items are also weighing on the stock s performance   Read more   Nordstrom s Numbers Are Not of Any Help EitherNordstrom continued with its dismal run  posting a negative earnings surprise of 42 2  in the first quarter of fiscal 2016  after an earnings miss of 4 1  and 19 7  in the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2015  respectively  In the trailing four quarters  the company underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 15 7  Nordstrom s fiscal first quarter earnings of 26 cents a share came in way below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents and declined 60 6  from the prior year quarter figure of 66 cents  Following the disappointing performance  the company lowered its outlook for fiscal 2016  Management now envisions fiscal 2016 earnings per share in the range of  2 50  2 70  down from  3 10  3 35 expected earlier Consequently  the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  2 55 and  2 87 for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 has dropped 63 cents and 64 cents  respectively  over the past 30 days  Moreover  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter has decreased 16 cents to 56 cents over the same time frame With Nordstrom s share price tumbling and estimates witnessing downward revisions  it may not be prudent to keep the stock in your portfolio  at least for the time being  Rather  you can shift your focus to better ranked retail stocks that are backed by a sound Zacks Consensus Estimate revision  a  of  A  and sturdy fundamentals 4 Prominent PicksWe suggest investing in Lowe s Companies  Inc    NYSE LOW    which holds a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  and has a VGM Score of  A  and long term earnings growth rate of 15 6   The Mooresville  NC based company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 0 6  over the trailing four quarters  This home improvement retailer is expected to witness earnings growth of 22 6  in fiscal 2016 and 15 9  in fiscal 2017  The Zacks

retailer of branded apparel products delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 23 2  over the trailing four quarters and has a VGM Score of  A   It is expected to witness earnings growth of 21 5  in fiscal 2016 and 16 5  in fiscal 2017  The Zacks Consensus Estimate too has been on the rise over the past 30 days Another stock that deserves a place in your portfolio is The Home Depot  Inc

surprise of 4 2  over the trailing four quarters  It is expected to witness earnings growth of 16 5  in fiscal 2016 and 13 1  in fiscal 2017  The Zacks Consensus Estimate too has been trending up over the past 30 days Last but certainly not the least addition to your portfolio can be BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI   with a VGM Score of  A   This operator of casual dining restaurants carries a Zacks Rank  2 and has a long term earnings growth rate of 17 9   This Huntington Beach  CA based company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 18 5  over the trailing four quarters  The

Factors Influencing the StockPer the company   ATM orders continue to be negatively impacted by large customer delays in spending in North America  weakness in India  the Middle East and Africa  and the upcoming Windows 10 conversion  Consequently  this is affecting NCR s top line performance  For third quarter 2017  the company s hardware revenues decreased 6  year over year on a reported basis to  578 million  The segment revenues from ATM and SCO also declined 16  and 24   respectively NCR Corporation Revenue  TTM 

   Nevertheless  the company is gaining in Software and Services revenues which increased 2  and 3   respectively  on a year over year basis in the third quarter  This represented increase in Cloud  Professional Services and Software maintenance revenues as well as hardware maintenance growth 
However  the weakness in the ATM market has been a potent threat for the company  which in turn negatively impacted the margins and the guidance for full year 2017 Going forward  we believe the company s focus on its core competencies and streamlined cost structure to be beneficial Zacks Rank and Key PicksNCR carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Some of the better ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Intel Corp    NASDAQ INTC    NetApp  Inc    NASDAQ NTAP   and IPG Photonics Corp    NASDAQ IPGP   sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   You can see

8791,230306,IPGP,Light Speed Returns From A Leader In Laser Technology  IPGP,opinion,"One of the best technology sectors right now has nothing to do with Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   Google  NASDAQ GOOGL   or Facebook  NASDAQ FB   It s in the area of photonics  In simplest terms  photonics is the science of light 
I want you to think about it for a moment   think about how  since almost the birth of humankind  light and optics have been there  From primitive people s fires to whale oil lamps to the electric light bulb to lasers   humankind s progression has been marked by advancements in the harnessing of light 
Fleshing out the definition a bit  photonics is the technology of generating and harnessing light and other forms of radiant energy whose unit is the photon  Photonics involves cutting edge uses of lasers  optics  fiber optics  and electro optical devices in a wide range of applications 
Photonics has taken its place alongside electronics as a critical and rapidly growing technology of the 21stcentury  The global photonics market is forecast to be a  720 billion market by 2020  growing at a compound annual growth rate of 35  
Welcome to the Photonics Century Photonics based applications are today used in a wide range of industries from industrial automation to medical diagnostics to scientific research 
Lasers in particular are displacing conventional technologies because they can do many jobs faster  better and more economically  Finding ways to make products more efficiently is an absolute must for today s manufacturers  That s why I strongly believe photonics and lasers are a must own sector for you and all my other readers 
One sector where photonics has become crucial is communications  Coherent light beams  lasers  have a high bandwidth and can carry far more information than radio or microwave frequencies  Fiber optics allow light carrying data to be piped through cables  replacing old copper cables  an absolute necessity in today s world of big data  cloud computing and video streaming 
Another way photonics has entered our everyday lives is solid state lighting  Light emitting diodes  LEDs  are a high performance  low cost  green alternative to incandescent light bulbs 
Then there is LiDAR  laser radar systems   which is used in the aerospace industry and is crucial for the future success of autonomous vehicles  those self driving cars that are frequently in the news these days 
Photonics technology has become ubiquitous 
Photonics has also become a key component in many manufacturing processes  Think laser welding  drilling and cutting as well as all the precision measurements needed by manufacturers that is provided by lasers 
Lasers Evolution That leads directly to my recommendation   IPG Photonics Corporation  NASDAQ IPGP   a leading developer and manufacturer of high performance fiber   diode lasers and amplifiers for a vast range of industries and applications  Its products are used in industries such as materials processing  communications  medical and biotechnology  science and entertainment  IPG Photonics has been in my  portfolio since late last summer and it s up 44  for us and has a wide path in front of it 
The evolution of lasers in manufacturing is a journey of over half a century  Its ready adoption by manufacturers is largely due to the fact that lasers convert common sources of energy into concentrated  directed beams of energy  To do this  a laser must have an energy source  a way of coupling that energy into the laser cavity  and a method of delivering the resulting laser beam to the workpiece 
The new fiber lasers developed by IPG are vastly superior to the old legacy industrial lasers in every facet of the process 

Energy Source  Instead of using energy sources like lamps or even chemical reactions  fiber lasers use long lived semiconductor diode lasers that efficiently convert electricity into light  Not only is the energy conversion efficiency raised  but frequent servicing and sometimes environmentally unfriendly consumables are eliminated 
Energy Coupling  Conventional laser optical cavities have bulky air or gas filled spaces  Large cavities are necessary due to the inefficiency of gas lasing or the need to insert bulk optical elements within the cavity  Fiber lasers are very compact because they convert semiconductor diode energy into useful laser beams within a fiber no thicker than a human hair 
Laser Beam Delivery  Legacy lasers utilize complex optics to extract the laser beam and deliver it to the workpiece  External steering optics are often needed to deflect the laser output onto its target  In contrast  flexible optical fiber provides a built in  ideal beam delivery system 
Mass Production Possible  Both key fiber laser elements   semiconductor diodes and optical fiber   can easily be mass produced  Quite a contrast from legacy lasers with their bulky hermetic laser cavities  their need for precision optical alignments and ultra flat optical surfaces 

The change is  as the company says  akin to the replacement of vacuum tubes by transistors 
IPG offers  I believe  the best in class laser based systems for high precision welding  cutting  marking  drilling  cladding  and other processing of metal  ceramic  semiconductor and thin films for customers in automotive  aerospace  railway  energy  electronics  consumer and other industries 
Its range of laser products includes ytterbium  erbium  thulium as well as Raman and hybrid fiber crystal lasers  All wattage ranges are there too  low  1 to 99 watts   medium  100 to 999 watts  and high  1 000  watts  output power lasers in wavelengths from 0 3 to 4 5 microns  The lasers can be continuous wave  CW   quasi continuous wave  QCW  or pulsed  The pulsed lasers are available in nanosecond  picosecond and femtosecond ranges 
Among the well known companies using IPG products are  Boeing  NYSE BA   Lockheed Martin  NYSE LMT   KLA Tencor  NASDAQ KLAC   Toyota Motor Corporation ADR  NYSE TM   BMW  DE BMWG  and Mitsubishi Electric Corp ADR  OTC MIELY  
Additionally  the company recently purchased Innovative Laser Technologies  ILT   This firm has a proven track record producing leading edge systems for medical device manufacturers  one of the fastest growing markets for fine welding and cutting applications  This will greatly aid IPG in its effort to penetrate the market for medical device applications 
Last May  IPG bought Menara Networks  which is an innovator in optical transmission modules and systems  This allows IPG to offer more integrated solutions for the telecommunications industry  In the first quarter of 2017  sales of its telecom products soared by 221  thanks to Menara 
IPG Growing Rapidly Although both North American and European sales grew 20  in the quarter year over year fully 64  of IPG Photonics revenues come from the Asia Pacific region  with another 25  coming from Europe  including Russia  Only 10 5  of its revenues come from North America 
China continues to be a driver of growth with year over year sales growth of 47  for the region and representing nearly 44  of total sales for the firm 
IPG Photonics Corporation reported Q4 2017 adjusted earnings of  1 86 per share beating the top end of estimates by  0 06  The figure was better than the guided range of  1 55  1 80 
Management expects sales to come in a range of  330 to  355 million for the first quarter  Earnings are estimated for  1 62 to  1 87 
IPG s Laser Bright Future Thanks to innovative product portfolio   last summer IPG unveiled the first 120 kilowatt industrial fiber laser   and large patent portfolio  I expect IPG Photonics to continue to outpace the other companies in the laser systems and components sector 
Another huge advantage over the competition is its vertically integrated business model  which allows it to control each and every part of its business from research and development to sales to after sales service  In this type of business  I want the company to continue to innovate 
So a purchase like that of OptiGrate  which help IPG develop new ultra fast pulsed lasers  is what I want to see  I like the fact that IPG is moving into new end markets connected to 3D printing  defense electronics and micro materials processing in addition to the aforementioned communications and medical sectors  This will only add to the momentum from trends such as the miniaturization of electronics and the move of the global auto industry toward the widespread adoption of fiber lasers

8794,230309,BJRI,Moving Average Crossover Alert  BJ s Restaurants  BJRI ,opinion,"BJ s Restaurants  Inc    NASDAQ BJRI   could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective  as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front  Recently  the 50 Day Moving Average for BJRI broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average  suggesting short term bearishness 
This has already started to take place  as the stock has moved lower by 8 6  in the past four weeks  And with the recent moving average crossover  investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for BJRI stock 
If that wasn t enough  BJ s Restaurants isn t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either  It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately  which is usually not a good sign of things to come 
Consider that in the last 30 days  11 estimates have been reduced  while one has moved higher  Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate  and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here 
That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell  on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead  So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for BJRI ",2016-08-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/moving-average-crossover-alert:-bj's-restaurants-(bjri)-200148538,200148538

8796,230311,IPGP,5 Momentum Stocks To Conquer The Market ,opinion,It has been two decades since academics zeroed in on what we today call the  momentum effect  in stock markets  Momentum is basically the tendency of winning stocks  i e  stocks that have outperformed the market in recent times  to keep winning and losing stocks to keep losing It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend  it is more likely to continue in that direction instead of moving against the drift  Unlike the hugely followed Value or Growth styles  this strategy has barely anything to do with the fundamentals of a company  and instead works with the human penchant to extrapolate current trends into the future At the core  momentum investing calls for investors to  Buy High  Sell Higher  Why Does Momentum Strategy Work There is a simple reason behind this  It works because we are humans There s a whole laundry list of behavioral biases that most investors exhibit  and these emotional responses and mistakes are the very reason that momentum strategy works  For instance  we all know of investors who are afraid to book losses  and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long  hoping that they will spring back to their original prices  On the other hand  investors sell their winners way too early Furthermore  investors initially tend to under react to news  events or data releases  However  once things become clear  they tend to go with the flow and overreact  causing dramatic price reactions These behavioral problems extend trends and thus open up huge opportunities for momentum players  So basically  it s a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future Momentum investing is based on that gap in time that exists before the mean reversion occurs  i e  before prices become rational again Momentum versus Other StylesIt is worth reflecting over how the momentum strategy compares with other styles of investing over time  Recent research indicates that the size premium for small cap stocks has shrunk dramatically since the 1980s and value premium has declined radically since the 1990s  Academics are of the opinion that once research on factor premiums  like size and value  becomes known to public  the investment world catches on and the premium gradually erodes However  unlike other investment styles  momentum premium has stood the test of time  remaining remarkably robust ever since it was identified by financial academics in the 1990s Chase the AlphaMomentum strategies have been known to be alpha generative over long periods of time and across markets  So obviously  this strategy is quite tricky to implement  as detecting these trends is no child s play Here  we have created a strategy that will help investors get in on these fast movers and make handsome gains  Our screen will help you take advantage of both long term price momentum and a short term pullback in price  which will reflect

over year On a non GAAP basis  the company posted earnings of  1 per share  up 7 5  from the year ago quarter  Earnings beat the Zack Consensus Estimate of 98 cents Revenues increased 1 7  year over year to  292 4 million and came slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  291 8 million  The year over year improvement was primarily driven by an increase in domain name registrations in the United States as well as in international markets Shares of VeriSign have gained 43 5  year to date  significantly outperforming the 25 5  rally of the  it belongs to Quarter DetailsIn the quarter  domain name registrations for  com and  net together grew 1 2  year over year to 145 8 million  In absolute terms  domain name registrations grew 1 47 million year over year  VeriSign processed 8 9 million new domain name registrations for  com and  net  an increase from 8 63 million processed in the year ago quarter Per management  during the quarter  59  of the revenues came from U S  customers while international customers contributed the rest For the reported quarter  the exact renewal rate figures will be available after 45 days from Sep 30  2017  The company estimates it to be 74 3  compared with 73  in the year ago quarter  It provided renewal rate for the second quarter of 2017  which came in at 74  compared with 73 8  in the year ago quarter MarginsVeriSign reported non GAAP operating income of  195 2 million compared with  187 6 million in the prior year quarter  The company s non GAAP operating margin was 66 7  in the quarter  up 140 basis points  bps  from the prior year quarter Non GAAP adjusted EBITDA was  214 1 million  up 4 6  from the year ago quarter Other Financial DetailsExiting the quarter  the company s cash and cash equivalents  including marketable securities  were approximately  2 4 billion compared with  1 81 billion as of Jun 30  2017 Operating cash flow in the quarter was approximately  175 million while free cash flow came in at  153 million  Moreover  in the first nine months of 2017  the company generated  503 6 million of cash flow from operational activities VeriSign repurchased 1 5 million shares for  147 million in the quarter  As of Sep 30  2017  the company had  622 million available under its current share repurchase program GuidanceVeriSign raised its full year guidance  The company now expects revenues in the range of  1 161  1 166 billion  up from the prior guidance of  1 155  1 165 billion  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revenues is  1 16 billion The company increased its non GAAP operating margin

the range of 0 4 million to 0 9 million Our TakeVeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated  com and  net domain industry  The company continues to benefit from strong demand for domain name registrations in the United States as well as in international markets Rise in bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading is also contributing to an increase in domain name registrations  which is a tailwind for the company  Furthermore  the agreement with ICANN  under which the annual fee for a  net domain name registration will be increased from  8 20 to  9 02  effective Feb  1  2018  will drive the company s top line going ahead Moreover  VeriSign s focus to utilize its robust cash flows to return value to investors through share buybacks is a positive However  the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to sales and marketing remain primary headwinds Zacks Rank   Stocks to Consider VeriSign carries a Zacks Rank

Quarter DetailsIn the quarter  domain name registrations for  com and  net together grew 0 8  year over year to 144 3 million  In absolute terms  domain name registrations grew 0 68 million year over year  VeriSign processed 9 2 million new domain name registrations for  com and  net  an increase from 8 6 million processed in the year ago quarter For the reported quarter  the exact renewal rate

approximately  1 81 billion compared with  1 79 billion as of Mar 31  2016 Operating cash flow in the quarter was approximately  181 million while free cash flow came in at  171 million  Moreover  during the first half of 2017  the company generated  328 9 million of cash flow from operational activities VeriSign repurchased 1 7 million shares for  150 5 million in the quarter and 3 5 million

quarter results  VeriSign raised its full year revenue and capital expenditure guidance  The company now expects revenues in the range of  1 155  1 165 billion  mid point  1 16 billion   up from the prior guidance of  1 145  1 160 billion  mid point  1 153 billion   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 revenues is  1 16 billion Capital expenditure is now anticipated to increase in the range of

name registration will be increased from  8 20 to  9 02  effective Feb  1  2018  However  the other terms of the agreement remained unchanged Our TakeVeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated  com and  net domain industry  The renewal of the  com contract and price hikes for the  com and  net domain names will continue to drive VeriSign s top line  Also  we believe that gTLD prospects  international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results  The company continues to benefit from strong demand in the U S  as well as in the international markets Additionally  VeriSign has significant growth opportunities in the Distributed Denial of Service  DDoS  security market  VeriSign also has significant growth opportunities in the network security products space  Strong demand for VeriSign s cyber security products  following ransomware attacks such as WannaCry and Petya is also a key growth driver  Also an increase in annual fee for a  net domain name registration will drive the company s top line results from next year onward However  the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to sales and marketing remain primary headwinds Zacks Rank   Stocks to Consider VeriSign carries Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see Better ranked stocks in the broader

8828,230343,IPGP,Brightcove  BCOV  Q2 Earnings  Is A Surprise In The Cards ,opinion,"Brightcove Inc    NASDAQ BCOV   is slated to report second quarter 2017 results on Jul 26 after the closing bell  Last quarter  the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 44 44   Moreover  it has delivered negative earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters  resulting in an average negative earnings surprise of 81 94  
Furthermore  we note that shares of Brightcove have fallen 31 1  in the last one year  substantially underperforming the  s growth of 38 2  

Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Brightcove is a well known provider of cloud solutions for delivering and monetizing video across connected devices  The company exhibited strong year over year bookings performance in the last reported quarter  despite a significant decrease in its revenue retention rate  primarily among media customers  Back then  the company had stated that it expects this to be a headwind over the next few quarters 
However  we are optimistic that its robust product portfolio and new product enhancements will drive bookings momentum  going forward 
Notably in April  the company launched Brightcove Live   an API driven scalable  cost effective solution to deliver and monetize live broadcasts  events and 24 7 channels  In May  it unveiled a broad set of innovative technologies  including Context Aware Encoding and Dynamic Delivery  Management believes these newly introduced features will continue to garner more customer interest and value for media customers  while purpose built solutions like Social  Audience and Gallery will cater to the needs of enterprises and digital marketers 
We also note that last month  TV Tokyo  one of Japan s leading broadcast networks  selected Brightcove Live for live stream of the Liebherr 2017 World Table Tennis Championships 
For the second quarter  the company expects revenue of  37  37 8 million  with non GAAP loss from operations anticipated to be in the range of  4 2  5 million  Non GAAP net loss per share is expected to be in a range of  0 13  0 15 Brightcove Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Brightcove is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Brightcove currently has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 19 cents per share  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Brightcove carries a Zacks Rank  3  Though a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some stocks that  as per our model  have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter

emphasize that revenues will be negatively impacted by the business model transition from  upfront  to  ratably  as well as lower initial purchase price of new offerings Improvement in average revenue

8837,230352,IPGP,What s In The Cards For Netgear  NTGR  On Q2 Earnings ,opinion,"Netgear  Inc    NASDAQ NTGR   is slated to report second quarter 2017 results on Jul 26  Last quarter  the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 5 77   Additionally  it has an average positive earnings surprise of 12 72  in the trailing four quarters 
However  we note that shares of networking equipment maker Netgear have decreased 9 7  in the last year  underperforming the  s advance of 4 4  

Let s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement 
Factors to Consider
Netgear designs technologically advanced  branded networking products that address the specific needs of small businesses and home users  We expect the company s strong product portfolio  comprising offerings like its Nighthawk WiFi routers and Arlo home security products  to boost the top line 
In particular  we are positive about the company s launch of the Arlo Baby Smart HD Monitoring Camera  ABC1000   in Jan 2017  Netgear s Arlo segment revenues jumped 150  year over year  driven by Arlo Pro in first quarter 2017 
We believe that Netgear s strength of Arlo and Orbi sales in the retail channel will primarily drive results  Region wise  North America continues to contribute the lion s share  65  of 1Q17 net revenue  
However  the service provider business continues to pose challenges with the company streamlining the segment  In the first quarter  the company reported a  28 3 million year over year decline in sales to service providers 
For the second quarter  the company expects net revenue of  315  330 million  with GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 5 3 6 3  and non GAAP operating margin in the range of 8 9  NETGEAR  Inc  Price and EPS Surprise

   Earnings Whispers
Our proven model does not conclusively show that Netgear is likely to beat on earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  This is not the case here as you will see below 
Zacks ESP  Netgear currently has an Earnings ESP of 0 00   This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 44 cents per share  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our  
Zacks Rank  Netgear carries a Zacks Rank  3  Though a Zacks Rank  1  2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP  the company s ESP of 0 00  makes surprise prediction difficult 
We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank  4 or 5  Sell rated  going into the earnings announcement  especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum 
Stocks to Consider
Here are some stocks that  as per our model  have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter 
Cypress Semiconductor Corp    NASDAQ CY   has an Earnings ESP of  11 11  and a Zacks Rank  1  You can see 
IPG Photonics Corp    NASDAQ IPGP   has an Earnings ESP of  3 07  and a Zacks Rank  1 
Lam Research Corp    NASDAQ LRCX   has an Earnings ESP of  1 33  and a Zacks Rank  1

positive record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters  with an average surprise of 6 95  Last quarter  the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1 54   Non GAAP earnings of 66 cents per share surged 22  from the year ago quarter but declined 16 5  sequentially Strong year over year earnings growth was driven by 7 2  increase in revenues  which totaled  14 80 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  14 81 billion  Revenues decreased 9 6  sequentially Intel guided second quarter 2017 revenues of around  14 4 billion      500 million   almost flat

while EPS is anticipated to be 68 cents      5 cents   up 15  on a year over year basis Despite the positive guidance  Intel s shares have underperformed the S P 500 on a year to date basis primarily due to rising competition in most of the markets  While the index gained 10 7   the stock has returned a negative 4 2  Let s see how things are shaping up for this announcement Factors at PlayWe note that Intel s growing focus into areas with better growth prospects  such as the artificial intelligence  AI   autonomous car and Internet of Things  IoT  businesses are key catalysts  In this regard  the acquisition of Mobileye  NYSE MBLY  is a significant development that will boost its presence in the autonomous vehicle market However  increasing competition in the data center market is a headwind  Reportedly  Microsoft  NASDAQ MSFT  is collaborating with ARM chip makers  Qualcomm   NASDAQ QCOM   and Cavium  to design ARM based servers  The server will run a major part of the company cloud services going ahead  Additionally  increasing competition from AMD s recently launched EPYC server chip is also a threat   Market research firm  Gartner  stated that worldwide server shipments decreased 4 2  year over year to 2 60 million units in the first quarter of 2017  Moreover  worldwide server revenues declined 4 5   Data from another market research firm  IDC  showed that although server shipments increased 1 4  year over year to 2 21 million units  worldwide server revenues declined 4 6  Sluggish high end  sales affected results  IDC noted that   server market growth continues to slow down with most hyperscale service providers waiting until the second half of the year for deployment of Intel s new Skylake processors  The data center business now comprises a major part of Intel s overall business  29  of 2016 revenues   Hence  a decline in the server shipment and revenues amid intense competition is a major concern for the company Notably  Intel recently launched its Xeon  formerly Skylake  scalable  Purley   a next generation server processor platform  However  it is unlikely to have much positive impact on top line growth in the going to be reported quarter We also note that the top PC makers like HP  Lenovo  and Asus are set to launch PCs based on Qualcomm s ARM based Snapdragon processor  which intensifies competition for Intel  Moreover  declining  is a major concern for the company Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Intel will beat earnings this quarter  This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold  for this to happen  That is not the case here as you will see below Zacks ESP  Intel s Earnings ESP is currently  1 47   This is because the Most
