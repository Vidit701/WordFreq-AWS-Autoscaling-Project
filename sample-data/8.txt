5600,227115,ASML,Applied Materials scraps Tokyo Electron takeover on U S  antitrust concerns,news,"By Emi Emoto and Junko Fujita TOKYO  Reuters    U S  based Applied Materials Inc  O AMAT  on Monday scrapped its  10 billion planned takeover of chip making gear rival Tokyo Electron Ltd  T 8035  after the deal  a rare foreign bid for a Japanese firm  fell foul of U S  anti trust regulators   The all share purchase would have combined the No 1 and No  3 makers of the equipment that makes semiconductor chips into a group with a stock market value of more than  38 5 billion  Tokyo Electron said both companies gave up on the deal after more than 18 months of talks after it became clear that differences with the U S  Justice Department could not be bridged  The reasons for the regulator s decision were not immediately clear  but California based Applied Materials said the U S  authorities had deemed insufficient a proposal to address antitrust concerns   We must take with humility the result that we could not convince the regulators   Tokyo Electron Chief Executive Tetsuro Higashi told reporters   The termination of the merger is a very regrettable outcome  but it does no good to mourn   Applied Materials  Tokyo Electron and No  2 maker  ASML Holding NV  AS ASML   hold 49 percent of the global market  according to market research firm Gartner  in an industry where the rising cost of developing chips  coupled with slowing semiconductor demand  are forcing alliances and acquisitions  The pan Pacific deal  announced in September 2013  would have been a rarity because the combined entity would have been listed in New York and Tokyo but incorporated in the Netherlands  home of ASML   Analysts had initially expected the takeover  aimed at spurring profit growth in both companies  to stand up to regulatory scrutiny  The unraveling of the deal is worse for Tokyo Electron  said a Tokyo based mergers and acquisitions lawyer  as takeover targets often lose management focus  and customers  during the negotiation period  CEO Higashi said Tokyo Electron would be  flexible in considering alliances with others in the future   To appease shareholders  both companies announced share buybacks  Applied Materials said it would buy up to  3 billion worth of shares over three years and Tokyo Electron said it plans to buy as much as 120 billion yen   1 billion  worth of shares  or 8 59 percent of its outstanding stock  No termination fee would be payable by either party  Applied Materials said

5603,227118,ENGIE,London or Paris  Choice proves a taxing question for bankers,news,"By Anjuli Davies
LONDON  Reuters    Forget fine wine  haute cuisine and art     the big question from London s bankers for a French delegation trying to lure them to Paris was  how much tax will I pay 
 Most were interested in income tax and executive tax on pay   Gerard Mestrallet  president of France s finance industry lobby Europlace who led Monday s roadshow  said 
More than 80 representatives from banks and business met with authorities from Paris who are highlighting the attractions of the French capital if Britain s exit from the European Union forces the relocation of some activities to continental Europe 
Global banks and insurers have begun signaling how they cope with a  hard  exit from the EU  after Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain would leave the single market 
And Brexit has opened up  fierce competition  among the main financial cities of Europe    which include Paris  Frankfurt  Dublin and Luxembourg    Valerie Pecresse  the head of the wider Paris region  said 
HSBC  L HSBA   Europe s biggest bank  has said it could move some of its operations to Paris  where it has a subsidiary that holds most of the licenses needed by an investment bank thanks to its purchase of CCF in 2000 
LABOR LAW CONCERNS
Pecresse estimated that the French capital could attract about 10 000 jobs  although bankers at the event raised concerns about French tax rules and labor laws as a possible deterrent 
 The expatriate regime has dramatically improved but there are also some concerns about labor flexibility   Mestrallet  who is chairman of French utilities Engie  PA ENGIE  and Suez  PA SEVI   said 
The French government introduced extra tax concessions for expatriates last year in the hope Paris could profit from Brexit  but experts say other centers with more flexible labor and tax rules are likely to be bigger beneficiaries 
With the exception of HSBC  most financial firms have yet to make a decision on relocation plans to Paris  according to Mestrallet   Many will wait three months to have more clarity on the outcome of the French elections  
Germany is also seeking to attract finance jobs from Britain  The country s senior regulators met about 50 envoys from foreign banks last week to explain how they could move business to Europe s biggest economy after Britain leaves the EU  German financial watchdog Bafin said 
But the Parisian delegation thinks it has the upper hand

5627,227142,ASML,Warnings from chipmakers point to wider economic slowdown ,news,"By Eric Auchard FRANKFURT  Reuters    Demand for electronics devices is weakening  according to circuit makers at the base of the industry s food chain  suggesting a long predicted slowdown in global economic growth may be coming to pass 
September  the peak month for shipping tiny chips used to build everything from appliances to cars to phones and office equipment if they are to reach consumers and businesses by year end  has not seen its typical pickup after the summer holidays 
In recent weeks  a series of U S  semiconductor makers with global operations have begun to paint a worrying picture of a broad based slow down in markets including autos and network equipment in regions ranging from Asia to Europe 
The weakness is centered in China  which functions as the electronics workshop for many finished products destined to ship worldwide  It may also be a sign of how pessimistic Europe s retailers are feeling ahead of the key Christmas trading season  with the euro zone in danger of sliding back into recession 
On Thursday came the remarkably blunt warning from diversified chipmaker Microchip  O MCHP  of a broad based industry downturn  or correction  suggesting worse may be in store as the latest corporate earnings season gets underway 
 We believe that another industry correction has begun and that this correction will be seen more broadly across the industry in the near future   Microchip Chief Executive Steve Sanghi said of the sales fall off in its latest quarter 
Semiconductor analysts struggle to find chipmakers which might be insulated from signs of a wider economic downturn 
 Any place to hide   asked BMO Capital Markets analyst Ambrish Srivastava in a note to clients   For the time  it appears not  
INVENTORY WORRIES
Shares in major European chipmakers suffered sharp declines on Friday  led by Germany s Infineon Technologies  DE IFXGn   which was off 5 8 percent  STMicroelectronics  PA STM  lost 5 4 percent and ASML Holding  AS ASML  gave up 3 5 percent 
Meanwhile  financial analysts who track inventory levels up and down the electronics industry supply chain have grown concerned by signs of a year over year build up in inventories among sales distributors  contract and component manufacturers 
While some stockpiling is inevitable in the current busy manufacturing season  the worry among investors is that this may be disguising even weaker demand for finished products 
Warnings have also come from niche semiconductor companies including EZchip Semiconductor  which cited weak orders from telecom equipment maker customers  and O2 Micro  which said several of its notebook PC customers were suffering weak demand 
Microchip is considered a proxy for broader demand across the global semiconductor industry because it is a highly diversified supplier of electronic components to some 80 000 customers  which in turn use its digital and analogue devices in finished products 
The company is also an early indicator because it recognizes revenue when its distributors book sales to customers rather than simply when Microchip itself ships its products  meaning there is less lag in seeing fundamental shifts in market demand 
China suffered a sales decline during the last three months where normally it would enjoy strong sequential growth compared with the June quarter  Microchip said in a statement 
Microchip responded by cutting back production levels in its wafer fabrication and test and assembly facilities  it said 
The company expects to return to sequential revenue growth in two quarters  assuming that the current imbalance in supply and demand follow normal industry recovery patterns  it said 
Ahead of Microchip s warning late on Thursday  the semiconductor industry was enjoying an upbeat year  overall  The 30 stock Philadelphia Semiconductor Index had gained 13 8 percent in the year to date

5630,227145,PUMG,Puma sees profit hit from U S  tariffs on China,news,By Emma Thomasson BERLIN  Reuters    German sportswear group Puma  DE PUMG  cautioned on Thursday that it would take a hit from U S  tariffs on China in the fourth quarter but still raised its sales forecast and narrowed its profit target after a strong third quarter in all regions   So far everybody is eating the tariffs in their margins   Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden told journalists  adding that he expected rivals to increase U S  prices  but Puma would not hike first as it is not the market leader  Instead  Puma would seek to shift even more production for the U S  market from China to countries like Vietnam and Indonesia  Gulden said   Production in China for the U S  market has already been cut to about 20  from more than 50  five years ago  he said  That has incurred extra costs as some styles are now produced in two places  However  it has not led to reducing production in China because the domestic market there is growing so fast and has absorbed volume previously destined for the United States    The fourth quarter will be the first quarter where the U S  tariffs on China will have an impact  Currently  without price increases  this is putting pressure on EBIT  at least in the short term   Gulden said  Puma said its third quarter sales rose by a currency adjusted 17  to 1 48 billion euros   1 65 billion   beating average analyst forecasts for 1 45 billion  while operating earnings were up 25  to 162 million euros  in line with analyst expectations  Inventories rose 28  to 1 14 billion euros as Puma front loaded products for the United States to beat the tariff rise  Puma s shares  which have risen by almost three quarters in the last year  were down 2 8  at 0842 GMT  the second biggest loser on the German mid cap index   The company s growth has been outpacing rivals like Adidas  DE ADSGn  and  Nike   N NKE   which recently reported that its quarterly revenue and profit beat market expectations as a push to sell sneakers direct to consumers gained pace  boosting margins  Puma said it now expects currency adjusted sales to rise around 15  for the full year  up from a previous forecast for 13   while operating earnings will come in at 420 million euros to 430 million euros  versus a previous 410 430 million range  In the third quarter  Puma s sales rose 28 5  in Asia Pacific and 17 9  in the Americas and recovered in Europe  the Middle East and Africa to 9 7   Growth in the Americas was powered by Puma s return to selling basketball products  while the European market was holding up well despite the lack of a major soccer tournament  Gulden said ,2019-10-24,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/puma-ups-guidance-despite-us-tariffs-on-china-2002948,2002948

5633,227148,ASML,Top Performing Country ETFs Of April ,opinion,"Even though April proved to be a stellar year for the U S  market  global growth worries are more or less intact  And why not 
In the fourth quarter of 2018  the Euro zone s economic growth was 0 2   the lowest since the second quarter of 2014  The Japanese economy shrank 0 6  sequentially in the third quarter of 2018  though it recovered 0 5  in the following quarter  The Canadian economy logged the growth since the second quarter of 2016 
Germany s automotive industry came under pressure because of new emission control standards  In France  the delay of Macron s reform agenda hurt growth  In Italy  there were concerns over fiscal deficit  per QNB 
On the positive side  there were oil price strength  signs of progress in U S  China trade talks   stimulus in China s economy  and Fed s  ECB s and Bank of Japan s  dovish outlook  As a result  though global GDP growth is slowing  a serious crisis looks unlikely    Investors should also note that the growth rate for the Euro zone has also improved in the first quarter of 2019

5655,227170,ASML,European shares hit 4 week low before US jobs data,news,"  FTSEurofirst 300 down 1 2 percent
   Banks  commodity shares top weighted losers
   U S  non farm payrolls due at 1230 GMT
   For up to the minute market news  click on
 
 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON  Oct 2  Reuters    European shares hit a four week
low on Friday  extending the previous day s sharp losses  with
investors anxious before key U S  jobs figures after data this
week raised doubt about the strength of economic recovery 
 By 1033 GMT  the FTSEurofirst 300 was down 1 2 percent at
970 14 points  after losing 1 6 percent on Thursday to a
three week closing low 
 The index  which has just posted its best quarterly gain in
nearly 10 years  was set for a third day of losses 
  There is a lot of negative in the background  which
suggests you don t want to be complacent about this being a
short term correction   said Geoff Wilkinson  head of investment
research at Mint  in London 
  Clearly people are buying bonds  we have got through the
key 3 3 percent yield level in U S  10 year  Treasury   and
people are buying yen  
 Banks  which have rallied 160 percent since March  were
among the top losers on concerns over the growth picture 
 KBC  UBS  Royal Bank of Scotland  BNP Paribas  Deutsche Bank
  Credit Suisse and Commerzbank lost 0 6 4 5 percent 
  The key thing      is whether we are going to get a turn in
financials  If they have another lurch lower  2 or 3 percent  it
will move beyond a gradual pullback to a more significant
correction of 10 percent plus   Wilkinson said 
 British insurer Legal   General shed 5 5 percent  partly
reversing a four day rally on the back of bid speculation 
 Commodity shares  which have also performed strongly in the
rally  were out of favour  Royal Dutch Shell  BG Group and Total
 dropped 0 4 0 8 percent 
 Among miners  BHP Billiton  Rio Tinto  Lonmin  Xstrata 
Vedanta Resources and Kazakhmys were down 0 9 percent to 4
percent 
 All eyes will be on the U S  non farm payrolls data for
September  due at 1230 GMT  for indications of the pace of the
recovery in the world s largest economy 
 Economists in a Reuters survey forecast 180 000 jobs were
lost in the month compared with a loss of 216 000 jobs in
August  while the unemployment rate was seen at 9 8 percent 
compared to a 9 7 percent rate the prior month 
 The dollar was flat against a basket of major currencies as
investors squared positions ahead of the jobs data and a meeting
of Group of Seven finance chiefs over the weekend 
 International Monetary Fund managing director Dominique
Strauss Kahn said it was not yet time to withdraw government
economic stimulus because of rising unemployment and a
still damagaed financial sector 
 The pan European index  which slumped 45 percent last year 
has rallied 50 percent since hitting a floor in early March  and
is up 16 6 percent so far this year 
 
 LOW RISK APPETITE
 The VDAX NEW volatility index was up 5 1 percent after
hitting a four week closing high on Thursday  The higher the
index  the lower is investors  appetite for risky assets 
 Across Europe  Britain s FTSE 100 was down 0 8 percent 
Germany s DAX fell 0 7 percent and France s CAC 40 shed 1 3
percent 
 U S  stock index futures pointed to a softer start for Wall
Street 
  We have been waiting for a correction for quite a while  
said Heino Ruland  strategist at Ruland Research  in Frankfrut 
  The third quarter performed pretty strongly  With the
beginning of the fourth quarter  we have to realise that the
economy is by far not in the shape which the performance of the
equity market would suggest  
 Technology shares also came under pressure  tracking
weakness from U S  semiconductors after poor results by
technology outsourcing and consulting firm Accenture 
 TomTom  Alcatel Lucent  ASML Holding  Cap Gemini and
STMicroelectronics lost 2 8 7 6 percent 
 Carlsberg sagged 5 percent after Deutsche Bank downgraded
the brewer to  sell   but SABMiller added 1 5 percent  helped by
Cazenove s positive comments 
 Munich Re gained 1 2 percent after receiving a boost from

5657,227172,ENGIE,New Russia Sanctions Could Push U S   EU Further Apart,opinion,"You would think that a stiffening of Washington s backbone when it comes to Russia would be welcomed by Europe  After all  it was Germany s Angela Markel that has led the tough stand taken against Moscow following the Russian sponsored uprising in eastern Ukraine and annexation of Crimea 
But on the contrary  cross party support in the US House of Representatives led to a 419 to 3 vote in favor of new financial sanctions against Russia this week  a move that has faced fierce criticism from Bonn and considerable debate about the wider implications 
The EU probably does not care about the inclusion of North Korea in the proposed sanctions  although it has taken a distinctly different and more tolerant line on Iran  the third regime included in the action  
But it is  in Bonn according to Carnegie Europe  a Brussels based think tank 
Impact on Europe
A post on the site reports the action could not only severely impact many European companies who have already invested heavily in projects  particularly in the oil and gas sector  but that it could also precipitate a political divide among Europe s partners  Seen in the context of this development  President Donald Trump s focus on Poland during his recent visit to the continent for the G 20 summit takes on a more sinister slant   at least  that is the view many Europeans are taking 
The bill singles out Nord Stream 2  a natural gas pipeline project which would expand an existing gas pipeline from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea  currently led by Russian energy giant Gazprom  MCX GAZP   Its partners  Carnegie explains  consist of five major European energy companies  France s Engie  PA ENGIE   the British Dutch firm Royal Dutch Shell  LON RDSa   Austria s OMV  VIE OMVV   and Germany s Uniper  F UN01  and Wintershall  Poland and the Baltic states claim  however  that Nord Stream 2 will increase  not weaken  Europe s dependence on Russian gas  and by circumventing Ukraine and Poland would reduce transit fees paid to countries with the original the Bratstvo and Soyuz overland pipelines 
Adding further angst in Europe is a suspicion the US sanctions bill is designed to deny Europe access to Russian gas so it will be forced to import more liquefied natural gas  LNG  from America s shale frackers 
Those involved with Nord Stream 2 wouldn t be the only casualties 
Companies working with the Russian energy company Lukoil  LON LKOHyq   which is developing the large Shah Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan  would also be fined  Carnegie explains  In addition  Caspian gas shipments to Europe via the Southern Gas Corridor  which would be fed gas from the Shah Deniz field  would be affected  That would deny Europe the chance of more energy security and diversification  Brussels claims 
Then there is the Caspian Pipeline Consortium  in which the US company Chevron  NYSE CVX  holds a 15  stake  That  too  would be hit  because Russia holds a 24  stake in the project  As for the planned Turkish Stream pipeline  which would send Russian gas to Turkey under the Black Sea  the proposed US sanctions would further increase antagonism between Ankara and Washington 
Disagreement about the policy is set to run as the details are hashed out  On top of environmental policy  NATO and possible trade sanctions fallout from the US Department of Commerce s Section 232 investigations  Europe and the US seem ever further apart

5658,227173,ENGIE,Russia Balks And The Italians Talk ,opinion,"Oil prices roared back after the Russia central bank sent signals that they were not very happy about the rapid drop in crude prices  and European markets bounced back as Italian political factions have decided to talk  This comes as there is more evidence that OPEC and Non OPEC have achieved their goal of getting rid of the global petroleum glut  The Energy Information Administration  EIA  reports that the global glut of oil and liquids is gone  as global supplies are back at the five year average 
This is not comforting as more companies are bailing on doing business with Iran as U S  sanctions loom while global demand is soaring  As we predicted years ago when everyone was telling you that cheap energy prices were here for the foreseeable future  we said that we were laying the groundwork for a new super bull cycle  While we may see another test of the lows in oil  that may be the next best buying opportunity this year 
When Saudi Arabia and Russia signaled that they were laying the groundwork for a potential oil production increase at the June 22 meeting to offset the plunge in Venezuelan output and the potential loss of Iranian supply  they had no idea that it would quickly take almost 8  off the price in a few days  They probably had no idea because the increase  rumored on the high side to be an increase of 1 million barrels a day  is only a drop in the bucket compared to what the market was losing from the OPEC bad boys  Iran and Venezuela 
So  when Reuters reported that the Russian central bank said falling oil prices would pose a risk to the country s financial sector  the market took that as a sign that Russia may not want to agree to raise output unless prices stabilize  And if Russia is worried about the sharp drop in oil prices in such a short period of time  you can bet your bottom barrel that the rest of the OPEC members are concerned as well  So traders  you must play close attention to the OPEC pre meeting on June 2 in Kuwait City as they meet to discuss  OPEC matters  ahead of next month s OPEC non OPEC meeting in Vienna 
Italy Cries  that is so two days ago  Not to make light of the financial and political issues in Italy and Spain but the market s reaction to the turmoil was overdone and ahead of itself  The Guardian reports that the leader of the Italian far right party  the League   Matteo Salvini  cancelled political rallies to return to Rome early on Thursday  in what was a sign that what has left the country without a fully functioning government for months might soon be coming to an end  Salvini was heading back to the capital to meet with his coalition partner  Luigi Di Maio  the 31 year old head of the anti establishment  Five Star Movement   to form a government 
The Guardian says that Italian press reports indicated that any agreement to form a new populist government involving the League  formerly known as the Lega Nord  and M5S would include the nomination   again   of Giuseppe Conte  a formerly obscure law professor  to serve as prime minister  But the two populists  Di Maio and Salvini  were expected to back down on their earlier insistence that the 81 year old Eurosceptic Paolo Savona  who had called Italy s adoption of the euro a  historic mistake   serve as finance minister  So  in other words the fears of a full blown crisis in the EU is unlikely and even if it does happen the global economy is in a much better position to handle it 
The real crisis may be another price spike in oil as companies run away from Iran  greatly increasing the odds that Iran s oil exports will be greatly reduced shortly  Reuters has reported on a few  French gas and power group Engie  PA ENGIE  said on May 18 it would end its engineering contracts in Iran by November  Poland s dominant gas firm PGNiG  PGN WA  has suspended a gas project in Iran because of the risk from U S  sanctions  its deputy chief executive said on May 18  French oil major Total  PA TOTF  said on May 16 it would pull out of the South Pars project and unwind all related operations by Nov  4  unless Total is granted a specific project waiver by U S  authorities with the support of the French and European authorities   There are surely more that will be added 
This comes as the glut is gone  Do you remember the oil supply glut that they said would never go away because of shale oil and OPEC not being able to comply with cuts  They told us that that we would have a glut for maybe decades to come  Well they forgot to factor in demand growth and the impact of a trillion dollars in capital spending cuts  and they did not pay attention to the changing political and economic dynamics in the OPEC Cartel 
The Energy Information Administration reported that total liquid fuels in the United States and OECD countries have returned to the five year average  The EIA says that global petroleum inventories declined through 2017 and the first quarter of 2018  marking the end of an extended period of oversupply in global petroleum markets that began before the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  November 2016 agreement to cut production  OPEC plans to reconvene on June 22  and markets now appear more in balance  but uncertainty remains going forward 
Because of the November 2016 OPEC supply agreement  which took effect in January 2017  OPEC member countries agreed to reduce crude oil production by 1 2 million barrels per day  b d  compared with October 2016 levels and to limit total OPEC production to 32 5 million b d  In addition  Russia agreed to reduce its crude oil production  OPEC extended the agreement in November 2017  with the production cuts remaining in place until the end of 2018 
The American Petroleum Institute reported that crude Inventories were up  1 001 million barrels  Gasoline was down 1 682 million barrels and distillates were up 1 466 million barrels while Cushing saw a drop of 132 000 barrels  The trade is awaiting the EIA version before getting too excited  Because of the holiday  we also get the natural gas number today and we should see an injection of 101 bcf ",2018-05-31,Phil Flynn,https://www.investing.com/analysis/russia-balks-and-the-italians-talk-200320838,200320838
5659,227174,ENGIE,U S  Sanctions Will Not Stop Nord Stream 2,opinion,"Summary

US may sanction Gazprom  MCX GAZP  s partners over Nord Stream 2 
Those threats are empty as Gazprom has options 
Nord Stream 2 s political importance make it a major bargaining chip 
Italy could torpedo Russian sanctions in July 

 This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing community  Stocks  Shocks   Rocks  
The Nord Stream 2 pipeline has created a massive amount of controversy  The US vehemently opposes the project on the basis of  European energy security  as it will further bind Europe s future energy needs to Russia s Gazprom 
Through proxies  such as Poland and the Baltic states  primarily Latvia  the US has worked tirelessly to stop the project  But the most recent statements by the US State Department make it clear that stopping Nord Stream 2 is a high priority for US policy makers 
Per a report from RT recently 

 Everything is on the table  The administration is taking a whole of government approach to stopping the Nord Stream project   the source said  as cited by the media 
Last summer  Congress approved the so called Countering America s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act  CAATSA   The legislation allows the White House to introduce punitive measures against the participants of the energy project  investing over  5 million in those enterprises 
 We have been clear that firms working in the Russian energy export pipeline sector are engaging in a line of business that carries sanctions risk   a State Department spokeswoman told the media 

Since 2014 s imposition of sanctions on Russia over the reunification of Crimea  the US and European Union have played power politics over Europe s future natural gas supplies  Nord Stream 2 is Gazprom s attempt to circumvent problems with Ukraine and its miserable relationship with Natfogaz 
I don t want to go into a detailed history of the situation  because it has been very well covered  To make a long story short  Gazprom has overcome every hurdle placed in front of it to not only resolve lingering issues with the EU s ever changing energy market rules  like the recent settlement of the anti trust suit  but also opposition to Nord Stream 2  And since the project has cleared legal challenges and has been issued all the necessary permits for construction  the only avenue left to its opponents is the naked application of political and economic pressure on its EU partners 
They are five European oil and gas majors   Royal Dutch Shell  OMV  Engie  Wintershall and Uniper  Each of them are potentially exposed to new sanctions imposed by the US for continuing to do business with Gazprom on Nord Stream 2 
Empty Threats
So  why do I believe all of this is simply nothing more than the big bad US huffing and puffing  Because Russia s fiscal situation is such that today it is a brick house rather than a straw one  Unemployment is low  inflation is tamed  GDP is growing  albeit slowly  and loan growth is good  as evidenced by Sberbank s recent earnings report as well as a recent press release from the Bank of Russia 
Mortgage loan growth  year over year  is 20 2  with NPL rates of just 1 3   And there is plenty of room for those numbers to improve  This type of loan growth is impressive despite the Bank of Russia being at least 50 basis points behind the curve 
So  to turn on the heat a little in Russia  another 50 basis point cut would be welcome and accelerate capital inflow by allowing foreign investment at lower costs of capital  The Bank of Russia has been too conservative in its handling of the recovery from 2014 15 s ruble crisis  in my opinion 
And it has hampered Russia s economic recovery  Russian banks are already cut out of US dollar markets  so sanctions on them really do not matter  Any dollars they need they can get through the central bank  which still has  100 billion in US treasury holdings according to the latest Treasury International Capital report or relationships with Chinese banks whom the US dare not sanction 
In the worst case scenario  the five companies listed above all pull out of their deal with Gazprom  it would leave the company needing to re issue the loans locally  Currently  these are loans payable in euros  Converting those loans to Rubles issued through currently stable Russian banks would be trivial with the Bank of Russia providing the needed euro liquidity  We re only talking  4 9 billion here 
Gazprom s latest earnings report was stellar with solid expansion across all verticals  Financially  the company is well positioned to complete each of the three major projects currently under construction   Turkish Stream  Nord Stream 2  and Power of Siberia 
Politics Cuts Both Ways
Nord Stream 2 is too important politically to future Russian European Union relations for it to fall apart at the last minute like South Stream did after US pressure on Bulgaria forced Russian President Vladimir Putin to pull the project and reroute it through Turkey  resurrected as Turkish Stream 
That miscalculation cost eastern Europe gas supplies it needed for growth as well as billions in transit fees for Bulgaria  That decision cost the Bulgarian government its rule and today s leadership is openly lobbying for a new version of South Stream which Gazprom has not committed to yet  This time  it could be German Chancellor Angela Merkel who would feel the wrath of voters  Germany needs Nord Stream 2  and  if Gazprom s Chairman of the Board Alexander Medvedev is to be taken seriously  Nord Stream 3 as well 
So  if she folds here to Trump s pressure it will likely spell the end of her government within the year  Local anger over her immigration policy as well as serving the EU rather than Germany first puts her chancellorship on shaky ground  And that s before the new government in Italy even makes its first official move 
Speaking of the Italians  the new Prime Minister Guiseppi Conte spooked markets with his inaugural remarks stating bluntly that current EU sanctions on Russia over Crimea need to be lifted  Will he instruct his Foreign Minister to veto their extension in July 
It s very possible  It s also possible that getting another six month extension of those sanctions will be a very serious bargaining chip between Italy  Germany and the US
Merkel has an out here  as I described in a blog post a couple of weeks ago  that could win her a ton of political capital domestically  And given what we just heard from Conte  this is now a very likely course of action 
As investors  if Italy ends the sanctions this will be very positive for Russian assets  It will open up investor floodgates fleeing the uncertainty of both Italian debt restructuring talks  Spain is now waiting in the wings thanks to Mariano Rajoy s ouster from power 
Expect Merkel and Putin to begin seeing eye to eye on ending the conflict in Ukraine again and pushing for commitments from Gazprom to guarantee gas transit through those pipelines after the current contract expires in 2019  Gazprom is a steal at RUB146 per share  or  4 62  It s trading at well below multiples of other oil and gas majors  heavily discounted for perceived political risk 
For US investors  however  a rising dollar will impact the upside in dollar terms as will a drop in oil prices  The markets are anticipating upwards of 1 million barrels to come off the market once new sanctions go on Iran and Trump now wants lower oil prices heading into the midterm elections  So  currency effects could shave five percent off the price  But  all the other positives  both near and long term should outweigh those concerns 
Look at Gazprom over a three to five year investment horizon and layer in a position accordingly  Remember  the firm pays its annual dividend in July so this is always a good time to begin building your stake

5660,227175,ASML,Chinese ambassador warns Dutch government against restricting ASML supplies,news,"AMSTERDAM  Reuters    Trade relations between China and the Netherlands would be damaged if Dutch semiconductor equipment supplier ASML  AS ASML  is not allowed to ship its newest machines to China  Beijing s ambassador to the Netherlands was quoted as saying on Wednesday 
Reuters reported last week that the Netherlands had withheld the license ASML needs to export its newest machines to China following pressure from the U S  government  
ASML  one of the Netherlands  largest companies  is a near monopolist in lithography  an essential step in the manufacture of computer chips  China has invested billions to develop its burgeoning semiconductor industry  but needs ASML equipment if its chipmakers are to compete with the best in Taiwan  South Korea and the United States 
 We are concerned that the Netherlands is politicizing our trade relationship under American pressure   Chinese ambassador Xu Hong was quoted as saying in the Het Financieele Dagblad newspaper 
 If this movement continues it will of course negatively affect bilateral relations  
After a lengthy trade war  the United States and China are expected to announce a limited trade deal on Wednesday that will not resolve disputes over technology transfers 
A spokeswoman for the Chinese embassy confirmed Xu had been interviewed by the newspaper  and said the embassy would publish a complete transcript later on Wednesday 
In the interview  Xu noted that China was an important export market for the Netherlands 
In 2018  the Netherlands also imported 39 2 billion euros   43 7 billion  worth of Chinese goods  two thirds of which was exported on to other countries 
ASML  which is due to report full year earnings next week  has said it can t ship its newest machines without a license  as they are considered  dual use  goods with potential military applications  It says an export request is under consideration 
Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters on Friday the government treated dual use export requests on a case by case basis and he would not comment on individual cases 
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Irene Gerritsen said on Wednesday the government did not have any new response in light of Xu s remarks

2018  All three major stock indexes  predominantly consisting of large cap stocks  witnessed the best first half of any year in more than two decades  Year to date  the Dow  S P 500 and Nasdaq

   Tech stocks rise after Intel results
 
 By Joanne Frearson
 LONDON  July 15  Reuters    European shares closed higher on
Wednesday  boosted by better than expected results by Goldman
Sachs and Intel  with banking stocks the biggest gainers 
 The pan European FTSEurofirst 300 index of top shares was
2 8 percent higher at 863 32 points  its best close in two
weeks 
 The benchmark index  which slumped 45 percent in 2008 due to
the credit crisis  rose 1 2 percent in the previous session and
has gained 33 percent since hitting a record low in early March 
  There seems to have been a consistent out turn of
better than expected results with Goldman and Intel today in the
U S  There is a growing conviction that recovery is coming and
we are leaving the worst behind   said Mike Lenhoff  strategist
at Brewin Dolphin 
 Banking stocks added the most points to the index as results
from Goldman Sachs on Tuesday helped push banking stocks higher 
 Barclays was up 4 4 percent  Several people familiar with
the matter said it is considering the sale of its private equity
business and will meet investment partners this week to discuss
the issue

of iron ore     Anglo American  Antofagasta  BHP Billiton 
Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation and Xstrata rose 3 8 4
percent 
 
 TECHNOLOGY STOCKS BOOSTED BY INTEL
 Technology stocks gained after U S  peer Intel s quarterly
results and outlook blew past Wall Street forecasts on
better than expected consumer demand for PCs      Further
helping fuel the feeling that the worst is over was
semiconductor producer ASML s estimates that sales would improve
in the next quarter   said Mic Mills  senior sales trader at ETX
Capital 
 ASML Holding was up 4 7 percent  The group said it expected
third quarter sales of around 450 million euros and a gross
margin of about 30 percent 
 Alcatel Lucent soared 10 9 percent  given further impetus by
Bank of America Merrill Lynch upgrading it to  buy  
 Ericsson  Nokia and Infineon Technology were 3 4 8 1 percent
higher 
 Porsche rebounded to gain 0 9 percent from earlier falls 
Porsche said its chief executive  Wendelin Wiedeking was to
remain CEO of the company after a German business weekly
reported that he was to leave 
 Looking at macroeconomic data  a strong reading on the New
York State manufacturing survey helped raise investor sentiment 
 The slumping factory sector in New York state nearly pulled
out of contraction in July  posting the highest reading in more
than a year as new orders surged  the New York Federal Reserve
said 
 Across Europe  the FTSE 100 index rose 2 6 percent 
Germany s DAX was 3 1 percent higher and France s CAC 40 was up

 By Dominic Lau
 LONDON  Oct 2  Reuters    European shares hit a four week
low on Friday  extending the previous day s sharp losses  as
investors were nervy before the U S  jobs figures after data
this week cast doubt about the strength of the recovery 
 By 0757 GMT  the FTSEurofirst 300 was down 1 percent at
971 93 points  after falling 1 6 percent on Thursday to a
three week closing low 
 The index  posting its best quarterly gains in nearly 10
years in the last quarter  was on track for a third day of
losses 
  We have been waiting for a correction for quite a while  
said Heino Ruland  strategist at Ruland Research  in Frankfrut 
  The third quarter performed pretty strongly  With the
beginning of the fourth quarter  we have to realise that the
economy is by far not in the shape which the performance of the
equity market would suggest  
 Banks  which have rallied 160 percent since March  were
among the top losers on concerns over the growth picture 
 KBC  UBS  Barclays  Societe Generale  BNP Paribas  Deutsche
Bank  Credit Suisse and Commerzbank lost 1 1 to 6 8 percent 
 But HSBC put on 0 6 percent  as traders said the bank was
the most defensive in the sector 
 Heavyweight commodity shares  which have also performed
strongly in the rally  were out of favour  BP  Royal Dutch Shell
  BG Group and Total dropped 0 4 to 1 1 percent 
 Among miners  BHP Billiton  Rio Tinto  Anglo American 
Xstrata  Vedanta Resources and Kazakhmys were down 0 3 to 2 1
percent 
 All eyes will be on the U S  non farm payrolls data  due at
1230 GMT  for further evidence of the pace of the recovery in
the world s largest economy 
 Economists in a Reuters survey forecast 180 000 jobs were
lost in the month compared with a loss of 216 000 jobs in
August  while the unemployment rate is seen at 9 8 percent 
compared a 9 7 percent rate the prior month 
 The dollar held steady against most major currencies with
investors sitting tight ahead of the jobs data 
 The pan European index  which slumped 45 percent last year 
has rallied nearly 51 percent since hitting a floor in early
March  and is up 16 8 percent so far this year 
 
 LOW RISK APPETITE
 The VDAX NEW volatility index was up 6 percent after hitting
a four week closing high on Thursday  The higher the index  the
lower is investors  appetite for risky assets 
 Across Europe  Britain s FTSE 100 lost 0 7 percent 
Germany s DAX fell 0 8 percent and France s CAC 40 shed 1 3
percent 
 Overnight  the Dow Jones industrial average and the S P 500
 suffered their worst one day fall in three months  while
Japan s Nikkei average fell 2 5 percent 
  Consumer expectations are now extremely stretched relative
to the dismal reality  This also occurred during the early 1990s
credit crunch   Societe Generale s Albert Edwards said in a
note 
  Back then expectations also ran up far ahead of reality 
Interestingly  after the recession had ended in March 1991 
excessively optimistic expectations slumped three more times
until muddling reality caught up with excessive hope  Markets
still have too much hope  
 European automakers were also weak after September U S  auto
sales tumbled by 23 percent as showrooms emptied after the
government funded boom from the  cash for clunkers  programme 
 Daimler  Renault  Peugeot  BMA and Volvo were off 0 4 to 2 8
percent  but Volkswagen advanced 0 8 percent 
 Alcatel Lucent  ASML Holding  Cap Gemini and
STMicroelectronics lost 2 4 to 5 2 percent  leading the tech
sector lower 
 Carlsberg eased 4 5 percent after Deutsche Bank downgraded

5678,227193,ASML,Semiconductor WFE Stock Outlook  Avoiding Is A Good Idea,opinion,"Wafer fabrication is a process during which a silicon wafer  usually 200mm or 300mm in size  is treated with successive layers of conductive and semiconductive material using stencil like structures called reticles  After each deposition of material on the surface  the excess material is etched away and the wafer exposed to a light source to implant the design  This is the front end process  The back end process is involved in cutting up the individual die  packaging for protection and use  attaching of electrical leads and sorting 
So wafer fab equipment demand is dependent on the level of the demand for semiconductors themselves on the one hand and the level of installed capacity on the other 
Researchers are divided on the wafer fab equipment spending environment 
Gartner is forecasting declines in both 2019 and 2020  attributed to weak business conditions and inventory glut at customers 
SEMI expects the 19  decline in 2019 to be more than made up by a 20  rebound next year  mainly because of gyrations in the memory segment  which will decline 45  this year and grow 45  in the next  If the forecast holds true  2020 sales will still trail 2018 levels 
The last few years have seen the proliferation of smartphones and other consumer electronics gadgets  as well as cloud infrastructure buildouts  With smartphone demand moderating and IoT demand accelerating  both these segments are likely to be the most important drivers of semiconductor demand along with artificial intelligence  HPC and automotive  Communications infrastructure  5G  will jump on the bandwagon soon 
The three main themes for the industry are Memory typically makes up the largest part of WFE spending  so oversupply and softer pricing account for the current weakness in this industry  Foundry spending has already started to pick up  the strong growth in major foundry equipment supplier KLA Tencor s  KLAC  earnings estimates is evidence China is playing a larger role  as a consumer  because of the government s initiative to make the country a major producer of semiconductors  But there s a certain opacity to Chinese functioning that brings uncertainty to the market  Add to that the real concern that China will produce so much that prices will fall further  The trade war also isn t helping things Technology transitions  an important consideration for equipment purchases  will continue to respond to the move toward larger wafer sizes  fab upgrades to 300mm  as well as continued demand for 200mm   shrinking nodes  10nm and 7nm   memory chip advancements  3D NAND processes are maturing  driving down cost   denser packaging  MEMS  and so forth  Materials research  device complexities  the need for greater manufacturing integration and new applications are also important Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Continuing Challenges
The Zacks  Industry is a stock group within the broader Zacks  Sector  It carries a Zacks Industry Rank  198  which places it in the bottom 22  of more than 250 Zacks industries 
Our research shows that the top 50  of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50  by a factor of more than 2 to 1  So the group s   which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks  indicates continued challenges going forward 
The industry s positioning in the bottom 50  of the Zacks ranked industries is a result of deterioration in the earnings outlook of constituent companies in aggregate  The industry s aggregate earnings estimate revisions in the past year of a 25 0  decline for 2019 indicates negative growth potential 
Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio  let s take a look at the industry s recent stock market performance and valuation picture 
Industry Lags on Shareholder Returns
The Zacks Semiconductor Wafer Fab Equipment Industry has outperformed both the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector as well as the S P 500 index over the past year 
So we see that the stocks in this industry have collectively lost 37 6  over the past year  while the Zacks S P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer and Technology Sector gained 2 3  and 1 6   respectively 
While the industry is small  players like Applied Materials  NASDAQ AMAT   Lam Research and ASML Holding  AS ASML  NV are very important players  
One Year Price Performance

 
Industry s Current Valuation
On the basis of the forward 12 month price to earnings  P E  ratio  which is a commonly used method of valuing semiconductor equipment companies  we see that the industry is currently trading at 21 0X compared to the S P 500 s 17 2X  It is also slightly above the sector s forward 12 month P E of 20 5X 
Over the past year  the industry has traded as high as 21 0X  as low as 12 4X and at the median of 16 7X  as the chart below shows 
Forward 12 Month Price to Earnings  P E  Ratio

Bottom Line
As evident  the market is expected to get a bit worse before it gets better  as in all cyclical industries that go through periods of relative weakness  But there are secular drivers of semiconductor demand that are positive for the wafer fab equipment makers after 2020 
Here s a list of stocks that display the above characteristics 
Lam Research  LRCX   The stock has gained 55 1  over the past year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the 2021 EPS  year ending June  is up 74 cents in the last 60 days 
Price and Consensus  LRCX

Applied Materials  AMAT   The stock has gained 33 5  over the past year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year EPS is up 3 cents in the last 60 days  for 2020 it is down 20 cents 
Price and Consensus  AMAT

ASML Holding NV  ASML   The stock has gained 32 1  over the past year  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year and next year EPS are unchanged in the last 60 days  But they are down a respective 19 cents and 8 cents from 90 days ago

Summary
One important consideration related to investing is the need to separate process and outcome  Making an investment decision based on one s proven process yet losing money can be a painful experience  yet par for the course  Separating decisions from outcomes is necessary to understanding process  A recent article in the Wall Street Journal  quoting successful poker player  discusses such behavior 
 To deal with uncertainty  she says  traders and poker players must develop resilience and learn not to be guided too much by  results based behavior   Put another way  they must learn that it is possible to do everything right and have a bad outcome  and it is possible to do everything wrong maybe by throwing a dart at a list of stocks and win big

Our previous Stock Exchange reviewed the relevance of sentiment for a trading time frame  We reviewed some of the sentiment indicators and offered our own viewpoint  A new market high speaks for itself  Thanks to readers who joined in with comments about their own methods 
This Week 
Most investors find the pain of losing significantly worse than the pleasure of winning  what behavioral economists call loss aversion  Therefore  investors are conditioned to seek out an investment process that wins most of the time to avoid the unpleasant feeling of losing  Or they add additional rules to their process to avoid the most recent painful trade  Seeking out ways to avoid the pain of loss is antithetical to a robust investment process   a highly successful systematic investment manager   

 In order for a system to be successful  it has to be what I call robust  Robust means that I can test that system in a market I designed it around  Say I m using it in the treasury bonds  and then if I switch that market and I try that system in the Euro  it still works  And if I change its parameters  it still works  And if I switch it over to corn   something totally different than treasury bonds   it still works  And if I look at some data that was out of sample from what I designed it around  it still works  Then I have something that might be interesting and have a chance of living in the future  Because the nature of data is it changes a little all the time  And so the key to success in systems trading is to have what I call a loose fitting suit  I can t have a suit that s so tight and perfectly proportioned to me that if I gain two pounds  it won t fit the data anymore  
Investors will always look for the  holy grail  strategy that will win all the time allowing for them to avoid the inevitable pain of loss  However  history demonstrates that utilizing a robust strategy and becoming more comfortable with the inevitable losing periods is the key to successful investing over time  What do you think  We welcome comments and discussion from other traders 
Expert Picks from The Models

Holmes  I bought shares of the Medicines Company    on November 14th 




TT  How do you feel about the trade 
Holmes  I purchased for technical reasons  Specifically  I am a short term dip buyer  and I like to buy attractive pullbacks  as you can see in the chart above 




TT  I see the pullback you re talking about  and it looks attractive so long as you believe the stock can bounce from here 
Holmes  As a technical trader  with a holding period typically around 6 weeks  I don t care too much about long term fundamentals  I sold this position for a 2  gain the next day 11 15 
TT  That was a very quick and attractive gain  thanks for sharing Holmes 





Road Runner  Interesting discussion guys  I recently purchased shares of ASML Holding NV    on 11 11  Any comments or questions 
TT  Why d you buy it 




RR  I like to buy attractive momentum stocks in the lower end of a rising channel  as you can see in the following chart 
TT  It seems like a rounded consolidation within a rising channel and trading at a multiyear high price  Attractive stock indeed 
RR  That s correct  There are a few more data points that go into each trade  but essentially  yes you got it 
TT  Okay  I think this trade has potential  Thanks for sharing  And how about you  Athena any trades to share this week 

Athena  I bought shares of Fortive Corp    on November 15th 




TT  Looks like it s breaking out of the recent downtrend 




Athena  I look for stocks having strong positive trends and then select only those with the very strongest trends   king of the hill    constantly replacing the ones with weaker trends  It should not surprise anyone that I bought Fortive  A quick look at the chart should make the strength of the trend obvious  And I generally continue to hold my positions until either the strength of the trend abates or a stock with an even higher trend strength comes along  I don t have a set  holding period  for a position  I will exit only when either a stronger stock comes along or if market conditions dictate a strong potential for loss   capital preservation remains the key driver in all situations 
TT  Thanks for sharing  And how about you  Emerald Bay 
Emerald Bay  I bought shares of Arconic    on November 13th 




TT  It looks like these shares have been rising steadily in a tight channel for months before you purchased 
EB  I seek exposure to the highest momentum names in our large cap equity universe  adjusted for volatility  Specifically  I like to base my position sizes on volatility with more capital invested in the less volatile stocks 
TT  You ve been doing quite well since purchasing this position and I suspect you ll hold it until the trend changes  Thank you for sharing 




Jeff  This time a good chart is supported by good earnings  As long as you are not a dividend investor  this is fine

5681,227196,PUMG,German business morale steadies  Ifo sees slight fourth quarter expansion,news,"BERLIN  Reuters    German business morale held steady in October and Europe s largest economy should expand slightly in the fourth quarter after contracting earlier in the year  the Ifo economic institute said on Friday 
Ifo said its business climate index was unchanged from the prior month in October at 94 6  That was just above the consensus forecast for 94 5 
 The German economy is stabilising   Ifo President Clemens Fuest said in a statement 
Europe s economic powerhouse contracted in the second quarter and many economists expect it to have shrunk in the third quarter  That would put it in recession   usually defined as a period of at least two consecutive quarters of contraction 
But Ifo economist Klaus Wohlrabe told Reuters   For the fourth quarter  we expect a slight expansion  
Ifo s index on current conditions fell to 97 8 from 98 6 in September  But its expectations index rose to 91 5 from 90 9 
Germany s export reliant economy has been suffering from slower global growth and business uncertainty caused by U S  President Donald Trump s  America First  trade policies and Britain s planned  but delayed  exit from the European Union 
 The uncertainty stemming from Brexit remains high   Wohlrabe said  but added   The downward trend in industry has stopped for the time being  
German sportswear group Puma  DE PUMG  said on Thursday it would take a hit from U S  tariffs on China in the fourth quarter but still raised its sales forecast 
Chancellor Angela Merkel s coalition government has resisted calls for a stimulus package to counter the slowdown

5699,227214,ENGIE,Exclusive  India plans new law to protect foreign investment   sources,news,"By Aditi Shah and Aftab Ahmed NEW DELHI  Reuters    India is planning a new law to safeguard foreign investment by speeding up dispute resolution  aiming to attract more capital from overseas to boost stuttering domestic growth  two officials with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters  In a 40 page initial draft  India s finance ministry has proposed appointing a mediator and setting up fast track courts to settle disputes between investors and the government  one of the sources said   The idea is to attract and promote foreign investment  but a major issue for investors is enforcement of contracts and speedy dispute resolution   said the official  The draft proposal is aimed at diffusing investor mistrust around the sanctity of agreements  which has worsened recently after some state governments decided to review approved projects  or threatened to cancel contracts  Both officials declined to be named as the proposal is not public  and is still being assessed by different ministries and regulators   A spokesman for the finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment  Foreign investors have highlighted the enforcement of contracts as one of their biggest concerns  said the second official  adding that improving on this front would also reduce litigation for the government  While investors can still rely on the existing legal system to settle disputes  it often takes several years for cases to be decided or settled   Investors previously had an option to take India to international arbitration courts under bilateral investment treaties  BITs  the government had agreed with dozens of nations  But  after suffering setbacks in overseas arbitration matters  India has allowed most of its treaties to lapse  giving investors little to fall back on in case of major disputes   BITs are agreements between two countries that give foreign investors protections  and among other things  legal recourse via international arbitration in disputes with a government  India is entangled in more than 20 such overseas arbitration cases   the most against any country   brought by companies including  Vodafone   L VOD   Deutsche Telekom  DE DTEGn  and Nissan Motor Co  T 7201  for disputes over retrospective tax claims and breach of contracts   If India loses these cases  brought before most of its BITs lapsed  it could end up paying billions of dollars in damages  The government s thinking is that India may not need to sign investment treaties with other nations if the new law  which is modeled on a BIT  can give confidence to investors  said the first source   A domestic law  however  cannot be a substitute for a BIT as its scope cannot allow investors to take their case to international arbitration  the sources said  CONTRACT WRANGLES  Though India s overall ranking in the World Bank s ease of doing business report has improved to 63 from 142 in 2014  it still ranks poorly   163 out of 190   when it comes to enforcement of contracts  The latest example of a contract wrangle is a dispute between the Andhra Pradesh state government in southern India and renewable energy companies  The state has been curtailing power procurement from the companies  citing high prices  and has pushed to renegotiate its supply contracts with them   Investors including Goldman Sachs  NYSE GS   Japan s SoftBank Group  T 9984   Singapore s GIC Holdings  the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and France s Engie  PA ENGIE  have invested in renewable projects in the state  The draft proposal for the new law includes a plan to set up an investment tribunal in state high courts that will take up cases as a matter of priority  or will see if the National Company Law Tribunal  NCLT   which also handles insolvency and corporate matters  can handle it   We are yet to evaluate what the risks of bringing such a law are and if it would do more harm than good   said the second source  adding that discussions were at an early stage  The finance ministry has held several meetings with other ministries to discuss the draft law  said the official  The most recent meeting in December was attended by officials from the ministries of commerce  external affairs and law  as well as the banking and stock market regulators  all of whom have been asked to submit their comments  said the first source  It was not immediately clear when the deadline to submit comments is  or when the next meeting will be held  The ministries and regulators did not respond to requests for comment  Pratibha Jain  a partner at law firm Nishith Desai Associates who advises foreign investors  welcomed the government plans  
 The idea is good and the government should consider broadening the scope to private disputes between foreign investors and domestic companies  as well as arbitrary rule changes by regulators  central bank decisions  and white collar crime cases that impact overseas investment   she added ",2020-01-15,Reuters,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/exclusive-india-plans-new-law-to-protect-foreign-investment--sources-2059765,2059765

5709,227224,AIRT,Non Farm Payrolls  Global PMIs In Focus,opinion,In the upcoming week  all eyes will be on key economic data both domestically and around the world and markets will be especially sensitive to the effect of these data points on Fed policy  Concerns over Fed tapering its Quantitative Easing program sent markets whip sawing in the previous week and these fears should continue for some time  Key Earnings This week  the earnings calendar is marked by few companies but still with some key reports  Discount retailer Dollar General  DG  is expected to report first quarter results alongside Ciena Corp   CIEN  and Titan Machinery  TITN   Dollar General Discount retail chain Dollar General is expected to report its first quarter operations on Tuesday  June 4  Analysts expect the company to report earnings per share of  0 71 vs   0 63 on revenue of  4 24 billion vs   3 9 billion a year ago  Importantly  Dollar General could comment on the state of consumer spending in the economy as its sales are sensitive to tax refunds  which were issued late this year  as well as tax rates  which increased in the first quarter  Analysts at Wedbush expect a largely positive report next week as they maintain an outperform rating on the stock   There is no specific guidance for Q1  but the company expected 2013 EPS of  3 15  3 30 with comps up 4  6   Management expected gross margins to contract at a rate higher than the rest of the year due to anticipated higher shrinkage  higher markdowns  and lower markups  which are mostly due to the impact of higher tobacco sales  However  gross margin erosion was expected to moderate during the rest of the year    We forecast Q1 EPS of  0 70 vs   0 63 with comps of  2 5  vs   6 7   consensus is at EPS of  0 71 with comps of  2 5   When it reported Q4 results on 3 25  management noted that QTD weather had been unusually cold  and we saw little improvement by the end of the quarter   However  management expected some eventual benefit from what it estimated as  18 billion in delayed tax refunds    Our  58 price target assumes DG should trade at approximately 15x our 2014 EPS estimate of  3 75  Our target multiple is in line with our projected L T earnings growth rate of 15   given quality of execution and longer term organic growth potential   Bank of America Merrill Lynch also views the company positively ahead of its earnings release  having increased its price target on the stock to  60 from  55 earlier this month  The analysts at BAML have a buy rating on Dollar General   We are upgrading Dollar General to Buy

next week  On Thursday  Ciena is expected to report a second quarter loss per share of  0 01 vs  earnings per share of  0 04 a year ago  Revenue is expected to grow to  483 34 million from  477 62

quarterly EPS of  0 19 vs   0 36 a year ago on revenue of  479 98 million vs   421 72 million a year ago  Notably  the company lowered quarterly guidance in late May and analysts reacted to this change  The company attributed the weaker operations in the quarter to the colder than expected weather postponing purchases of equipment  Analysts at M Partners commented on the preliminary operations and the full quarterly report   For Q1 F14  Titan expects fully diluted EPS will be between a loss of  0 01 and a loss of  0 03  We were expecting fully diluted EPS of  0 22 in Q1 F14  consensus was  0 18  The consensus range of EPS estimates is  0 13 to  0 22    Titan expects revenue in Q1 F14 to be  440 0 million  We were expecting revenue of  480 4 million in Q1 F14  consensus was  478 3 million   up from  421 7 million in Q1 F13 with about half of the revenue increase stemming from acquisitions made in the 12 months ending April 30  2013   M Partners expects a loss of  0 03 per share for the quarter following the guidance  Piper Jaffray also cut estimates after the guidance came out and commented on the stock ahead of earnings   We are lowering our estimates following management s below consensus 1Q14 pre release and downward revision to FY14 EPS guidance  As we expected  Titan s April ending quarter was negatively impacted by the late spring in both agriculture and construction  Management expects 1Q revenue of  440 mil and an EPS loss in the range of   0 03      0 01   both falling below our previous street low estimates    Our FY14 EPS estimate of  1 82 is near the midpoint of management s revised guidance range of  1 70    2 00  which is down from the previous range of  2 00    2 30  We are also lowering our FY15 EPS estimate to  2 09 on continued difficulties in the construction segment and a shift in mix of lower margin sales    Price target drops to  21  Neutral  We are applying a lower valuation multiple of 10x CY14  11x prior  as we believe shares of TITN will trade more in line with the peer group multiple  With expectations that 97  mil acres of corn will get planted in time and minimal visibility into improvements in construction we do not see any catalysts in the near term that will expand valuation multiples   Key Economics Releases Next week  the real focus of markets will be on the economics calendar and how

5710,227225,MITSY,Secret Scheme To Manipulate Silver Price ,opinion,"The lawsuits against banks that alleges they engaged in a secret scheme to manipulate the price of Silver bullion is proceeding 
Litigation alleging that Deutsche Bank  Bank of Nova Scotia and HSBC Plc illegally fixed the price of silver were centralised in a Manhattan federal court yesterday  The banks have been accused of rigging the price of billions of dollars in silver to the detriment of investors globally 
Lawsuits filed by investors since July over the allegations were consolidated yesterday in the U S  District Court for the Southern District of New York  following an order issued last Thursday by the U S  Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation  a special body of federal judges that decides when and where to consolidate related lawsuits 
The banks abused their position of controlling the daily silver fix to reap illegitimate profit from trading  hurting other investors in the silver market who use the benchmark in billions of dollars of transactions  according to the suit  
Investors claim  the banks unlawfully manipulated silver and silver futures 
Sharelynx
The U S  Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ruled that the cases should be handled by U S  District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan  who is already overseeing similar litigation over alleged gold price fixing 
Three lawsuits were originally filed in Manhattan  and two were filed in Brooklyn  The plaintiffs in the Brooklyn lawsuits had sought to have the litigation consolidated there 
The banks had also asked that the litigation be consolidated in Brooklyn  in the Eastern District of New York  However  the multidistrict litigation panel said Manhattan made more sense because the defendants all had corporate offices there and also because the cases involved issues similar to the gold litigation 
The plaintiffs allege that the banks abused their power as participants in the silver fix  a London based benchmark pricing method dating back to the Victorian era  in which banks fixed silver prices once a day by phone  
In August  the system was replaced by a new benchmark system administered by the CME  Chicago Mercantile Exchange  and Thomson Reuters  NYSE TRI  
HSBC  NYSE HSBC  spokesman Neil Brazil declined to comment and representatives of the other banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment 
This follows the initiation of similar actions against some bullion banks for alleged gold price manipulation earlier this year  The three named banks  Deutsche Bank  NYSE DB   Bank of Nova Scotia  NYSE BNS  and HSBC are alleged to have abused their position at the LBMA to profit from inside knowledge 
The fixing of the price of silver is a daily operation where banks on the panel of the LBMA agree on a price for the precious metals which are then used throughout the financial  jewellery and mining industries throughout the day 
It is alleged that some of the banks who fix the price  position themselves advantageously in the silver market before the price is made public  
 Defendants have a strong financial incentive to establish positions in both physical silver and silver derivatives prior to the public release of silver fixing results  allowing them to reap large illegitimate profits   plaintiff Scott Nicholson told the AFP 
Separately  Bullion Desk reported yesterday that J P Morgan Chase   Co  NYSE JPM  is now the fifth accredited member of the silver pricing benchmark  the LBMA has confirmed  with others parties  in the pipeline   a spokesman said 
The American multinational bank which has been the subject of silver manipulation allegations by Max Keiser and others  took part in its first silver benchmarking session yesterday 
A spokesperson said they had completed  strict regulatory controls  for accredited members  
JP Morgan becomes the fifth member  alongside HSBC Bank USA  Mitsui   Company  OTC MITSY  Precious Metals  the Bank of Nova Scotia   ScotiaMocatta and UBS  NYSE UBS  AG 
Furthermore  the LBMA has confirmed that several other parties are also in the process of joining the list  subject to passing regulatory requirements 
Several Chinese banks have expressed interest in participating in the new global price setting mechanism for silver  according to the head of the LBMA 
The LBMA ushered in a new era of electronic benchmarking for London s precious metals market in August when an algorithm was used for the first time to set the benchmark price for silver after recent scandals regarding price fixing and concerns about the nature of the gold and silver fix 
It will be interesting to see if Chinese banks partake in the new fix process as the concern is that the fixes remain the play things of certain western banks and are not representative of global physical demand and supply of actual gold and silver bullion  
Manipulation of the silver market was covered in a recently released  presented by Jan Skoyles  Mark O Byrne of Goldcore com was interviewed and the interview was an indepth look at this silver market today

5723,227238,BERK,Coca Cola  bowing to pressure  amends employee equity plan,news,"By Devika Krishna Kumar and Anjali Athavaley   Reuters    Coca Cola Co  facing criticism from Warren Buffett and other investors for its outsized employee share rewards  said it had adopted new guidelines that would limit its stock compensation plan and improve transparency   The company said its new guidelines would extend the number of years award shares will last  formalize its practice of share repurchases to minimize dilution and renew commitments to open dialogue with shareholders on compensation matters   About 83 16 percent of shareholders voted for the company s 2014 equity plan when it came up for renewal in April  according to a Coca Cola filing following the company s annual meeting   However  the approval figure included a significant number of shareholders who had abstained from the vote  according to Reuters calculations   Buffett  whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc holds 9 1 percent of Coca Cola and is the company s biggest shareholder  was among those who abstained   The billionaire said in an interview with Bloomberg that while he considered the plan to be  excessive  he did not vote against it out of loyalty to the company    But it has been Wintergreen Advisers  which owns less than 1 percent of Coca Cola on behalf of clients  which has been the most vocal critic of the company s equity plan  saying it greatly diluted the holdings of current shareholders    Coca Cola has finally conceded that the equity compensation plan it put to a vote of shareholders in April was outrageously excessive and inconsistent with past plans   Wintergreen Chief Executive David Winters said in an emailed statement on Wednesday    No amount of backtracking by the Coca Cola board of directors can hide the fact that we believe it tried to sneak one by shareholders in Coca Cola s proxy materials and statements at the April shareholder meeting   he added   Wintergreen said in September that proxy filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed that funds managed by State Street  Fidelity and Capital Group voted against the plan    It looks to be a very unique approach to tell shareholders how the shares under this equity plan will be used with a great deal of responsibility  while addressing the criticisms about the plan from Berkshire as well as the other shareholders   Frank Glassner  chief executive of Veritas Executive Compensation Consultants  told Reuters   Under the new guidelines  Coke s compensation committee will limit the grants under the equity plan to an annual  burn rate  of no more than 0 8 percent in 2015  The burn rate refers to the number of shares granted as a percentage of outstanding shares   The guidelines will also facilitate a shift toward performance shares and be less heavily weighted toward stock options    We consider the shift positive in that it means lower  automatic  payout of equity   Stifel analysts wrote in a note   Coca Cola said it expected shares authorized under the equity plan to last the full term of 10 years

Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  
Stocks from Winning   Losing Sectors  Post Fed Meeting
As widely expected  the Fed stayed put in the latest meeting and hinted at rate cuts this year  The central bank will now  closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook   Though the Fed acknowledged about the economic wellbeing  it addressed that  uncertainties about this outlook have increased   
More Fed members are now foreseeing a rate cut by next year  Nine members see the possibility of up to two rate cuts in the same frame of time  With inflation expectations tapering off  we expect some policy easing this year 
Inside Economic Forecast
The Fed upgraded its forecast for 2020 real GDP growth from 1 9  in March to 2 0  but maintained the 2019 and 2021 growth forecasts at 2 1  and 1 8   respectively  The Fed projected the longer run growth measure of 1 9   Unemployment was guided down to 3 6  from 3 7  for 2019  3 7  from 3 8  for 2020 and 3 8  from 3 9  for 2021 
PCE inflation expectations were cut from 1 8  to 1 5  for 2019 and from 2 0  to 1 9  for 2020  but were kept intact at 2 0  for 2021  Federal funds rate projections for 2019 were kept maintained at 2 4  but lowered to 2 1  from 2 6  for 2020 and to 2 4  from 2 6  for 2021  Over the longer term  the rate is projected at 2 9   same was cut to 2 5  from 2 8  projected in March 
Market Reaction
The immediate impact should be felt in the bond market and the yield on 10 year U S  Treasury dropped to 2 03  from 2 06  recorded the day earlier  As the policy easing move is largely expected  yield on short term two year bond yields fell a steeper 12 bps to 1 74   
Against this backdrop  we highlight a few sectors that could gain lose from Fed activity and guidance 
Winning Sectors 
Gold Miner  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd    Up 2  on Jun 19

Real Estate  NexPoint Residential Trust Inc    Up 0 5

to pass a short term spending bill that ends the recent government shutdown  Additionally  an upbeat fourth quarter earnings season  which includes a very strong revenue momentum  an above average

5803,227318,AFSIM,Insurance Stocks Q2 Earnings Due On Aug 8  AFSI  PRI  STFC,opinion,The second quarter earnings season is busy wrapping up with only 16  members of the elite S P 500 Index left to be reported  Per the latest   the performance of 420 index members  accounting for 86 7  of the index s total market capitalization   having already reported their financial numbers this quarter  indicates that total earnings have increased 11 6  on 5 6  higher revenues  The beat ratio is impressive with 74 3  companies surpassing the bottom line expectations and 68 3   outperforming with the top line The  sector  one of the 16 Zacks sectors  has delivered a strong performance till now and is almost done with results  99  companies on the S P 500 Index  accounting for 88 7  of the index s total market capitalization  that have already reported quarterly results  shows 8 7  earnings growth on 3 6  increase in revenues  both on a year over year basis  The beat ratio of 77 9  for the bottom line and 68 4  for the top line compared favorably with that of the S P 500 The second quarter witnessed several catastrophe losses  likely to weigh on underwriting results as well as the bottom line of insurers  Per Aon Benfield  the global reinsurance intermediary and capital advisor of Aon plc  NYSE AON    the estimated amount of catastrophe losses suffered globally is  53 billion in the first half of 2017  A few insurers have incurred losses due to severe wind and hail catastrophe events  occurred during April May in the U S Nonetheless  prudent underwriting standards should have helped the insurers guard against the capital reserve erosion  conserved on a benign catastrophe environment  Net investment income  a major component of an insurer s top line  has witnessed improvement  albeit far lower than the historical highs  The Federal Reserve has been increasing the interest rates  reflecting confidence in the developing economic conditions  In fact  the Fed has raised interest rates thrice in three quarters  A better rate environment not only increased net investment income but has also improved investment yields Higher rates should offer some respite to the life insurers which suffered spread compression on products like fixed annuities and universal life due to continual low rates  Annuity sales should have also benefited from higher rates  However  life insurers have considerably curbed their exposure to interest sensitive product lines Notably  an improving economy means more disposable income and a better consumer sentiment  This in turn might have also prompted more policy writings  thus driving the premiums higher to generate a lion s share to an insurers  top line  Besides  core business growth  geographic expansion  strategic buyouts and prudent capital deployment via share repurchase have probably encouraged the insurers On the flip side  we do not expect robust pricings  To write new business and retain renewals  insurers have been reducing the pricing pressure  Commercial property  workers  compensation and general liability were mostly experiencing this low pricing Let s find out where the following insurers stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Aug 8 AmTrust Financial Services  Inc    NASDAQ AFSI   underwrites and provides property and casualty insurance in the United States and globally  Last quarter

5830,227345,AFSIM,Oil  Fed And Politics Pressure Markets,opinion,"U S  equities finished lower ahead of tomorrow s highly anticipated monetary policy decision from the Fed  with expectations high for a 25 basis point rate hike  while political uncertainty across the pond continued to fester  Energy issues came under pressure amid a drop in crude oil prices in the wake of a bearish OPEC report showing a jump in production from Saudi Arabia  Treasury yields declined despite a hotter than expected producer price inflation report  while the U S  dollar was higher and gold lost ground 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average  DJIA  declined 44 points  0 2   to 20 837  the S P 500 Index lost 8 points  0 3   to 2 365  and the NASDAQ Composite decreased 19 points  0 3   to 5 857  In moderate volume  748 million shares were traded on the NYSE and 1 6 billion shares changed hands on the NASDAQ  WTI crude oil fell  0 48 to  47 72 per barrel and wholesale gasoline was unchanged at  1 58 per gallon  Elsewhere  the Bloomberg gold spot price declined  5 16 to  1 199 14 per ounce  and the dollar index a comparison of the U S  dollar to six major world currencies was 0 4  higher at 101 69 
Hd Supply Holdings Inc   NASDAQ HDS  41  reported 4Q earnings per share  EPS  of  0 26  or  0 44 ex items  compared to the FactSet estimate of  0 43  as revenues rose 3 2  year over year  y y  to  1 6 billion  roughly in line with forecasts  The industrial distributor issued 1Q EPS guidance that missed expectations and shares were solidly lower 
Shares of Moneygram International Inc   NASDAQ MGI  16  surged after the company received a takeover proposal from Euronet Worldwide Inc  NASDAQ EEFT  83  for  15 20 per share in cash  valuing it at more than  1 billion  EEFT said the offer represents a 15  premium over MGI s previously agreed upon takeover by AmTrust Financial Services Inc  NASDAQ AFSI   MGI has not commented on EEFT s offer 
Producer price inflation hotter than expected  small business optimism dips slightly The Producer Price Index  PPI  showed prices at the wholesale level in February were up 0 3  month over month  m m   above the Bloomberg expectation calling for a 0 1  gain and compared to January s unrevised 0 6  rise  The core rate  which excludes food and energy  rose 0 3   versus forecasts of a 0 2  advance and January s unrevised 0 4  increase  Y Y  the headline rate was 2 2  higher  north of projections of a 1 9  increase  and the core PPI rose 1 5  last month  matching estimates  In January  producer prices were 1 6  higher and up 1 2  for the headline and core rates  respectively 
The National Federation of Independent Business  NFIB  Small Business Optimism Index for February dipped to 105 3 from January s 105 9 level  compared to forecasts calling for a decline to 105 6 
Treasuries finished higher  as the yield on the 2 year note was flat at 1 37   while the yield on the 10 year note declined 3 basis points  bps  to 2 59   and the 30 year bond rate decreased 4 bps to 3 17  
The markets are awaiting tomorrow s conclusion of two day monetary policy meeting from the Federal Open Market Committee  FOMC   expected to deliver a 25 bp hike to the target for the fed funds rate  The statement and accompanying updated economic projections are poised to also garner heavy attention  with the markets looking to see if the pace of rate hikes is expected to accelerate beyond current expectations  This will be followed by the customary press conference by Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen  which typically garners scrutiny 
The FOMC decision will be preceded by a plethora of economic reports such as MBA mortgage applications  the Empire Manufacturing Index  the Consumer Price Index  CPI   retail sales  the NAHB Housing Markets Index and business inventories  The read on consumer inflation will likely garner the heaviest attention  Core CPI is estimated to come in at 2 2  y y for last month  a slight deceleration from the 2 3  gain in January  but the FOMC s favored core PCE Index remains slightly below its longer run objective of 2 0  
Earlier this month  FOMC Chairwoman Janet Yellen bolstered rate hike expectations by noting that the economy is close to meeting the Fed s goals of maximum employment and price stability and that gradual increases in the fed funds rate will likely be appropriate in the months and years ahead to keep the economy from significantly overheating 
The economic picture continues to look good  but inflation is heating up  and we are watching to see if this could force the Fed s hand  History compiled by Strategas Research Partners shows that the best stock market performance during a rate hiking cycle comes when the Fed moves slowly in the first year  but quicker in the second year  That pattern appears to be panning out in this cycle 
Europe dips as political uncertainty festers  Asia mixed
European equities finished lower  with oil   gas and financial stocks leading to the downside amid some caution ahead of tomorrow s highly expected rate hike in the U S   while crude oil prices fell on an OPEC report showing a jump in production from Saudi Arabia  Political uncertainty in the region also garnered heavy attention to likely hamstring sentiment  with U K  Brexit uneasiness continuing to flare up as Prime Minister May was granted the right to trigger Article 50  which will begin the formal process of negotiating the nation s exit from the European Union  following Scottish First Minister Sturgeon s news yesterday that she will start the legal process of preparing for a second independence referendum  Also  the markets are paying attention to tomorrow s Dutch election  which will set the stage for next month s key French Presidential election 
In economic news  eurozone industrial production rose by a smaller amount than expected for January  while German investor confidence improved by a smaller amount than forecasted for this month  The euro dipped and British pound fell compared to the U S  dollar  while bond yields in the region were mixed 
Stocks in Asia finished mixed  with the markets digesting some diverging Chinese economic data and as the markets appear to be treading cautiously ahead of tomorrow s highly expected rate hike in the U S  Moreover  European political uncertainty continues to ramp up  likely weighing on conviction  Japanese equities dipped  despite some weakness in the yen  while those traded in Australia finished flat 
South Korean securities rose  extending a run that has ensued in the wake of last week s court ruling to uphold a parliamentary vote to impeach President Park  and markets in India jumped in a return to action following yesterday s holiday and following the weekend s state elections that showed Prime Minister Modi s party won by a larger amount than expected  Stocks in mainland China ticked higher and those traded in Hong Kong were little changed following reports that showed the nation s industrial production and fixed asset investment topped expectations  though retail sales missed forecasts for last month 
Tomorrow  the international economic calendar will offer employment data from South Korea  India s trade balance  industrial production and retail sales from Japan  CPI from France and Italy  and employment figures from the UK ",2017-03-15,Marvin Clark,"https://www.investing.com/analysis/oil,-fed-and-politics-pressure-markets-200178981",200178981
5831,227346,AFSIM,P C Insurers  Earnings Reporting On May 8  AFSI  NGHC  MHLD,opinion,The Q1 earnings season is in full swing with 78 2  members of the elite S P 500 Index reporting solid quarterly

particularly the property and casualty companies  are likely to witness improvement in underwriting results owing to a benign catastrophe environment  However  impact of storms in Midwest and the South that occurred during Feb 28 and Mar 22  as well as cyclone Debbie in Australia weighed on underwriting results Nonetheless  the improving interest rate  albeit at a slower pace  should cushion investment results that suffered due to the prolonged period of low rates  Owing to a stabilizing economy  improving employment and inflation reaching 2   the Fed raised interest rates in Dec 2016 and in Mar 2017   Investment income  which is a major component of insurers  top line  is improving  Also  a stronger economy means more disposable income and better consumer sentiment  This  in turn  is likely to have supported more policy writings  driving premiums higher Prudent underwriting practices should also have supported investors  However  we do not expect pricings to be strong  Nonetheless  core business growth  geographic expansion  strategic acquisitions and effective capital deployment via share repurchase should prove beneficial for insurers Per our earnings outlook  results from
