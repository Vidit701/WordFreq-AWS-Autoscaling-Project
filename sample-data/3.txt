The greatest suspense comes from the awful overacting Mr Douglas who is trying to give up smoking - will he? Won't he? Ms Stone iks embarrassingly bad. It is redeemed somewhat by Mr Dzundza and the elegant Ms Tripplehorn.

It has been remained by people for lots of years because of Sharone Stone's nice and smooth body. It's sad but true. Basic Instinct shows us a lot of bad things. Like nudity, sex, murder, violence, and things like bad language. Some people hate this film because of these kind of bad things. But think about this film in a different way. When I saw the script of this film, it was terrific! I could just call it perfect. People have to remember this film as a film that have great thrills and a great story.

The whole thing is an unintentional joke (sort of like Stone claiming she didn't know where the camera was positioned in the interrogation scene).

Sharon Stone and Michael Douglas were dead on; extremely believable characters and even after it was all over my sister had to explain to me that of course Katherine Tremell was the killer because of the icepick under the best. Then I rewatched and understood the whole way the other woman was set up by Catherine and the brilliance of it all tying into her bestselling novel. The movie was thrilling! And Sharon Stone never looked hotter or any woman for that matter than Catherine in this film. Michael Douglas was great as the quesionable cop; likable but with an edge and a dark side. Catherine Tremell was the DARK SIDE period. I'd give it ten stars if I could!!",

80068,__label__1,"So, about that trumpet...: Miles' first studio album after a six-year retirement (though he had previously released the live double We Want Miles) is essentially an attempt to jump on the trends - this is more of an '80s funk record than a jazz album, especially displayed on the title track, with grating if smoothly delivered vocals. Which means this is mainly ponderous and trivial - take the extended ""Back Seat Betty"", which makes use of '80s guitar. Hide me. And too much of it is that insulting style we call jazz-pop which brought Kenny G. success- take ""Aida"" or ""Shout"". Not a stain on Miles' career, thanks to deep, lengthy grooves ""Fat Time"" and ""Ursula"". But one of his least creative.",

80070,__label__1,"Fat Time, followed by a lot of lean moments: Also known as his 1981 ""comeback"" album (his first recording in 6 years), Miles shows a lot of rust in his playing, and most of the songs indicate he's uncertain as to whether to go for a vintage '70's ""Get Up With It"" style or widen the appeal with forgettable pop songs.Only the opening tune ""Fat Time"" sounds assured. On that track, Mike Stern rips loose an incredible rock guitar solo that ebbs and flows perfectly, with Miller and Foster seeming to egg him on with strong support on bass and drums. Miles' muted horn before and after sounds a little weak, but provides a nice balance to Stern's fire.If you pay full price for this CD, avoid buyer's remorse by not letting the CD player go past track 1. Miles doesn't fully come back until ""Star People"" a couple of years later.",

In later chapters, Greek quotes from the New Testament are used in the exercises.One of the problems with this book is that some of the exercises refer you to the Greek New Testament (GNT) which means you'll have to buy a GNT to complete those exercises.

The music meanders for a bit and then a few minutes into it Jerry Garcia decides to sing. It continues in this fashion for the rest of the album. This is signaled out as one of their best albums but still. The Dead were fans of Coltrane and admitted his influence (so did the Byrds but Eight Miles High is a classic song) but couldn't really absorb the aspects of jazz fusion in the way that say, Hendrix did. Basically you get a series of unfocused jams that wear you out. You kind of forget where the song goes and eventually the band remembers to return to the theme. The scary thing was how influential the Dead and this album were. If you're a deadhead, I doubt you will be swayed by this review but if you're not buy any 70's Miles album or Jimi Hendrix official concert albums and see that Live/Dead can't live up to its musical contempor",ries.

If Matthews has any in-depth knowledge of American history, he failed to reveal it here. Further, his simplification of the forming of the ""American psyche"" is laughable.Although 200+ pages in length, the book is an easy one-sitting read -- I read it all last night. Why?

This book tries to tie in history, famous figures, and movies. Well, I suppose there is something to this, but history is history and not stories in movies. The other tenet in this book is the characteristics of Americans that make them different from the rest of the world. Again a long stretch.

Instead of treating children's icons like pinatas, this movie is an homage to them. The script was written for children. It completely lacks adult humor, and any humor at any level period. In all honesty, there is one lone exception: a scene by Robin Williams, where he slams into a brick wall in a spoof of a scene from Singing in the Rain.

The reason I replaced the other model was because its coating came off in the dishwasher and it was harder to clean.

The one strange thing that happens with mine is that water will get trapped in the handle and leak in my drawer after it comes out of the dishwasher.

For that reason alone, I would not recommend this tool for anyone experiencing ongoing pain in their hands; this press will surely aggravate it.

I constantly find myself having to add an extra clove to a recipe to account for the unused garlic that inefficient press leaves behind. 3) Lastly, the metal material used for the hinges is poorly made. Due to #1, bad leverage, I found myself having to press both handles of the press against the counter (instead of squeezing it in my hand).

If you are pressing many cloves as I usually do and you don't scrape off the garlic on the outside before putting a new glove in, the handle can swing too far open grabbing all the garlic you just pressed out leaving it stuck in the prongs. This press is heavy in the hand but it takes a good amount of pressure to push the garlic through and it you have arthritis you probably would not be able to use this. The hinge part takes a lot of stress I would not put more then one clove at a time I think it would eventually snap off. Not my favorite item from a company that makes so many wonderful gadgets.

Finally, after giving it one last chance, I threw it in the trash. I use a fair amount of garlic in cooking, and when I do, I still mince it myself with a knife because the garlic press is so inadequate to the task, which is what I recommend your doing rather than wasting your money on the Oxo Good Grips Garlic Press, at any rate. What is wrong with it is that the ""minced"" garlic does stick to the press and it is too much of a hassle to remove it to get the press clean, much less to actually use the minced garlic in food.

The dance steps are taught a little fast at first but after a few attemps it is not hard to follow. I like the yoga sections that are incoporated into the routine. I have found that if you want to make the ab section more challenging substitute a weighted ball for the beach body squishy ball used and you will increase the intensity. Over-all this is a good series. I have already bought several others and have a fun time when I use these videos.

Many of the tracks on this two disk CD go beyond the main theme music and are actually suites. The ""Big Country"" and ""How the West Was Won"" are just a couple of examples.

He can play everything and he can play everything very well. He has a great voice with great control, but he's got no soul. The music is very cheesy and predictable. After a few songs, which all start sounding the same, I was so bored that I was regretting buying the tickets to see Susan. I acutally felt sorry for the musicians that he hires because there's no way anyone that I know would want to play this without getting some $$.Thankfully Susan came out and kicked ass and made me completely forget about this guy. When I was leaving someone was talking about how his recordings were great so I checked out this disc to give him one more try, but it's just safe poppy middle of the road music.

But Greene's arrangements are deeper and more complex and except for the couple of aforementioned songs, fully fleshed out with a full band. Make no mistake, the guy has developed his own voice and isn't simply a clone. Great range of themes here on this disk, too, from playful to songs of lost love, and of a friend who died too young.

I'm not so sure what a genius like Miles Davis was thinking when he put this one out, but this was a big let down.

While so-called die hard fans of Miles or jazz used adjectives such as ""flop"", ""poor quality"", and ""worst"", it is anything but...The only slight unstable choices he made was to do cover instrumentals of Michael Jackson's Human Nature and Cyndi Lauper's Time After Time at a time when the original songs were still fresh. Instead, he should have opted for writing a couple of original tunes himself (even if they were only going to be filler material---the key word being original).These two tracks ended up being played as light elevator music tunes in department or grocery stores. The rest of the album, however, showed that Miles could adapt to the changing times and styles of music in order to reach younger listeners as well. No longer was his music exclusive to hardcore jazz purists...Miles Davis is for the entire world !",

John Scofield, Darryl Jones, Bob Berg (I love Bob Berg), John Mac, and many others. Two songs from this disc, ""Time After Time"", and ""Human Nature"", became a staple for Miles in the 80's till his death. These songs were introduced here, so it is an improtant disc. ""MD1/Something's On Your Mind/MD2"" is just the coolest, hippest, deept groove that you are going to hear. Seven minutes of it. If you want to know why Miles is so cool, this is the cut. I would buy the disc just for this. The opening cut is silly with the rap, but who cares. The whole disc is a cool groove. It holds my interest all the way through. Very cool Miles.",

The transfer to DVD was so poor it had barely a sharper picture than my VHS.It's a shame such a fine film should be butchered for what is otherwise a decent medium.It's bad enough that the left and right side of the frame is chopped off for the 4x3 version and most widescreen versions with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1, but to further cut off the top and bottom is a disgrace.",

Most of the special features are just interviews with the people who put the film together, talking about what they did for the film. Be sure to listen to the DVD commentary with Macaulay Culkin and Chris Columbus. It's interesting to watch deleted footage that didn't make the film as well.

He LOVED ""Home Alone 3,"" but ""Home Alone,"" downloaded for $3.99, was ho-hum in contrast. The movie always aggravated me with its gratuitous ""Ahhhhhhhh"" from Culkin, but its biggest offense is that it tries to be a cartoon and real movie at the same time.

Stowe was very well aware of the plight of these people and she wanted to make a change. She wanted to make her feelings about the evils of slavery known to the public. She wouldn't allow people to ignore the tragedies surrounding them because it was socially acceptable at the time. Although this novel is a work of fiction it accurately displays the lives of American slaves in the 1800's. In fact, the main character, Uncle Tom, is based upon the autobiography of Josiah Henson, and other slave narratives. She also appeals to the reader through emotional pulls that are easy to identify with, as if you were experiencing what the characters were.

The white women characters cared more about the slaves than the white men. They didn't want to sell or break up families.Uncle Tom was an uncommonly good and honest man and devouted Christian. He was sold when his owner needed money. At first he was sold to a man who was ok, but then he was sold to Simon Legree. Legree was a mean man.

Some parts may cause you to place your hand over your mouth and shake your head side to side in shame and remorse for victims but that does not take away from the comedic aspects of the film. This film is comedy, mild horror, romance, and suspense all at the same time.",

81048,__label__2,"Great, Brutal Nordic Metal: It's interesting to still see that even in modern times, bands are still writing material about Nordic gods and warlords wreaking havoc upon infidels and enemies alike. This album by Amon Amarth stands out in that it is both incredibly brutal and yet has a very strong underlying message: infidels and heathens (especially christians) should prepare for an ultimate reckoning at the hands of Odin and all his comrades. This album does not let up after you first push play, and it truly makes you wish you were on some hill in the days of old leading hordes of Nordic savages and vikings down upon those who dare to test your wrath with their devotions. On top of all this, the production is top quality. The clarity of the instruments and vocals are superb, and this album all around further enforces the fact that the Scandinavians are still leaders in phenomenal metal. I highly recommend this to anyone who's a fan of absolutely relentless, brutal metal in",he Nord

Now to the Amon Amarth album at hand...Unfortunately, Martin Lopez did not continue playing with Amon Amarth, his drumming is superb. That doesn't really effect the quality of Amon Amarth's music, however, as The Crusher proves to be the strongest, most aggressive album thus far. Johan Hegg relies mostly on his battle-screams, while the band concentrates on crushing, semi-melodic death metal riffs and blasts. After you buy ""Versus The World"", get The Crusher. Or better yet, order them at the same time.Standout Tracks: Annihilation Of Hammerfest, Bastards Of A Lying Breed, Masters Of War, As Long As The Raven Flies, The Sound Of Eight Ho",ves

However, if they are good at writing songs within their style and their fans like it (like me) then why not stick with what you are good at. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. The songs on the Crusher are more technical than their previous album, just like Avenger was more technical than Once Sent, and the Crusher is less hook-laden, which is not necessarily a good thing. Bastards of a Lying Breed starts this album off with pure speed and aggression. There are a few stand outs, but they will be different for everybody, because if you have heard their first two full lengths, then you have heard this album. It's just too bad the Crusher doesn't have a song as strong as Last With Pagan Blood or Friends of the Suncross.

There are layered tracks of Jerry's voice singing perfect harmonies. What made the Dead great was that they were far from perfect (not including most performances the year 1977) and their imperfections made them one of the last honest and improvisational rock bands out there.

Some of the essays weren't as powerful to me as the others but I believe that has to do more about me then the book.Carl Jung's writing can be difficult and sometimes complicated to follow. For those who take the time to head and understand the deep and philosophical questions that Jung answers about life and psychology, your view on life will truly be transformed."" The needs and the necessities of individuals vary. What sets one free is for another a prison--as for instance normality and adaptation (Jung, 1933, pg. 47).""",

The plate that mashes down on the potatoes is not a very tight seal so you will have some small amount of potatoes that squeeze through the top part, but it's OK, I just throw those in with the mashed potatoes as well because they come out mashed.

Took a long time to bite the bullet to buy a gadget that I'm likely going to use for only one dish, but it was worth it. My potatoes come out crisp with a nice texture now.

I was never able to actually take the thing apart for the so-called ""easy cleaning,"" and it broke very quickly. I think I had it for a year before it started cracking (with low usage - maybe used 20 times. Maybe.) When it did work, it grated well. But I returned it and got an old-fashioned box grater instead. I'm much happier with that, knowing that the stainless steel will not break anytime in the near future!",
81459,__label__1,ok until it breaks is right!: Mine did break too. I ended up buying a box grater soon after I bought this one. When I did use it I was more worried about cutting my self because it was so unstable. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this product!,

The plastic is poor quality (i.e., too weak for intended use and this design) and the design is faulty (too little plastic aroun each metal shred grid). Best to buy an old style handle-at-top all-metal one at thrift store or Goodwill rather than this extemely poor product. A complete waste of money and time, in repairs.

It developed cracks in the plastic that are impossible to repair. Also, I do not think this is a good grater for the supposed market of arthritic people - it can be difficult to put together.So, in short, it stinks for those suffering pain in their hands and for those who cook. Save your money and just buy a KitchenAid grater.",

First, it tries to fold up while you're grating cheese, which is downright annoying, so I started using it unassembled, which worked for a very short while until it cracked (about the 5th time I used it). Then it cracked more. And more. And more, until all that was left was the metal grating plate. Even though it hurts to hold it while grating, and it's highly inconvenient, I've been using it this way for 4 years now, since I refuse to buy a new grater until I'm sure I find one that won't fall apart like this one.

At first it broke into two pieces, so I could only use one half (even when it stood upright as pictured, it never did stay open or grip the counter- it was never stable, and either closed or fell down while grating). Then I was left with a flat grater that was difficult to use. The piece that was left cracked on the corners, and broke apart within a couple of uses. Usually Oxo makes great products. This is not a good product. Save your money and buy a different model grater. You will be happier with an all metal model for sure!",

His albums AFTER this one do not come close to the earlier ones like Tumbleweed, Madman, Honky Chateau or Don't Shoot Me. GYBR is a very good album- with some great material. A few of my favorites are Sweet Painted Lady, Grey Seal, All the Young Girls Love Alice, Funeral/Love Lies Bleeding, Danny Bailey, I've Seen that Movie too. Definitely worth buying!

The Ballad of Danny Bailey, Harmony, Roy Rogers, and Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting are the kind of story tunes that draw you in and sparkle with John/Taupin genius.

After less that a week, on average, the sponge separates from the plastic backing that attaches it to the soap dispensing handle, rendering it useless.

The plot line is rather involved and Cornwell does not spend much verbiage on a recap. Also if you are a fan of the Sharpe novels (as I am) it is not long before you start seeing the similarities (ex: Sharpe with faithful Irish sidekick Sgt. Harper, Thomas with faithful Scots sidekick Robbie Douglas). This however is a minor quibble, Cornwell is a master at blending history and a good yarn into a seamless enjoyable package.",

Even given the notable lack of self-control of Cornwell heroes when it comes to women, in this case the major plot line was Thomas abandoning his course for the woman. The only motivation offered for Thomas's attraction is her beauty. But there is absolutely no indication of any character lurking beneath the body! I haven't counted, but I doubt she has more than 30 words of dialogue in the entire book. For the hero to make a 90-degree behavioral turn for a woman, one has to understand the woman to understand why he would do so. Because there is no credible explanation, the book from a story perspective has to fail. I hasten to add that the historical accuracy, battle scenes, etc. are Cornwell's normal high quality.",

And not much show of possessiveness, jealousy, nor romance between the two. No sign of pain nor struggle when apart. Just a flat ""love"" story. And surprisingly, how it is titled, the Sherbrooke Twins, would suggest to readers that both the twins would find love. Unfortunately, only one does and its James.

I felt more emotion out of the stoic Edward Wilson in the Movie ""The Good Shepard"" Fortunately ""Jason"" was developed a little more towards the end to allow ""Lyons Gate"" to be a potentially decent Romance nove.

So I was quite psyched to put this rare movie in the DVD tray the other night for an evening's entertainment. From the opening credits I knew something was off - instead of an ultra-cool French movie from the 60s, I was presented with a very strident 1930s British movie about fishing trawlers (see The Last Adventurers (1937)).What a disappointment! At first I was incredulous and expected to see a grainy Alain Delon make an appearance, but alas he would have been a 2-year old toddler. What makes matters worse is that this movie was obviously captured from a tape source and is a poor presentation of the boring 1937 film. After about 5 minutes I accepted I had wasted my time and money (hello Amazon) and that Alain would be sitting this one out. Either this is gross incompetence or outright bait-and-switch, but do not be deceived by the cover art on this",Synergy

Problem is, the lightweight base has a very shallow hole to receive said metal spike, so Sammy's body tends to lean heavily atop the shallowly-anchored spike once assembled on the base. You have to position him carefully, to avoid the whole model just toppling over. Also, carefully concealed in the box is a short black plastic rod which is necessary to mount the bat to the base.

Her children are grown, one in college and one in China for two years. Her husband, Tom, works in Washington, DC and returns to his home in Atlanta only on weekends. The book starts on Katharine's 46th birthday.The characters in this book are very well drawn and the plot situations are realistic. One likes the protagonist and her family and friends. Reading the first book made me want to read the second, ""Sins of the Fathers,"" which I have done. Again I like the descriptions and the characters.I do have a problem with the mystery part of these books. I have some trouble understanding the motives of the murderers. Perhaps the author could have Katherine explain it all at the end to her husband, Tom, or her son in China. I will keep reading the books. I just want a little more tidying up at the end.",

I love every other item I've tried that carries the OXO name, but this one is a miserable failure. My main complaint is that when you line the screw up with the cork, and the wings are down, there's nowhere to grab for stability when turning the knob on the top. You have to kind of poke your fingers between where the wings meet and squeeze. Once you do get it going, half the time it only goes part of the way in and you end up with a half-removed, or worse - broken - cork.Terrible terrible terrible.

81870,__label__2,"A Good Effort: Like all their previous records, JOC has crafted an unusual and different picece with ""The 11th Hour."" However, even though a few songs (notably ""Silence"" and ""Revolution"") have a certain attractive ring, this album is generally a little less brilliant than their previous ones. It has such a very dry (no reverb), raw-but-clean sound to it that (to me anyway)it just doesn't quite work the whole time. Also I think that songs like ""Fly"" are arranged a little too ""bouncily"" and lose what could have been a heart-wrenching mood (though the line ""now you're alive"" is one of the most poignant expressions of Heaven that I have ever heard). Despite the imperfections, though, ""The 11th Hour"" is a strong cut above most music you'll hear released in this age of pseudo-grunge; I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates something not run-of-the-mill.",

Don't worry, many of the songs still the acoustic Jars of Clay sound. The element of this album that truely stands out is the passion and emotion put into the lyrics. Example: Silence. The lead vocalist vocals are sang with incredible passion in a song about the doubts many face. Songs such as Fly and The Edge Of The Water also have great vocals. The Edge of The Water is the final track on the album which expresses the hope and longing of our savior's return. The album also features more upbeat rocker tunes like Revolution and Whatever She Wants. Overall this album is full of diverse well written songs with passionate singing of incredible lyrics.

I had purchased Overjoyed before, and, save for a few notable exceptions, was less than thrilled. The Eleventh Hour rekindled my love for the band! The song 'Revolution' is the best song on the entire album. I go for more hardrocking groups and songs, such as TobyMac and Pillar, or The Benjamin Gate. Even if you don't like softer rock, this album is both inspiring and, though it does not talk about God openly, has very subtle Christian elements.",

Each of their first four CD's were very distinctive sounding, (Though 'Much Afraid' could have done so much more).On thier fourth CD 'The Eleventh Hour', they've really put all the pieces together, both lyrically and musically. The pulse is livlier than ever on songs like 'Revolution' and 'Whatever She Wants', taking their sound to a harder direction than on prior CD's.The poetry of the lyrics is just plain awesome, painting vivid word pictures through symbolism, allegory, and even in-your-face straight-on candidness.

Sometimes you can listen to music and you have to play it many times before it captures you. I own two Jars Of Clay albums and the first time I hear them I instantly like them. They are fresh, positive and perfect packages of music. The hooks, the melodies and the lyrics are all well structured. This is the only Christian music I own. And to be honest with you, I do not like to put any label on a band or performer. Because we tend to judge and shy away from music if it is in a certain category.

81884,__label__1,"return to roots?: i must admit i was quite disappointed with jars's latest. although i frequently hear that the band is ""returning to their roots"", i find nothing even remotely similar to their early work except that they produced it themselves. i have been forced to come to terms with the fact that jars of clay is in a downward spiral, both musically and lyrically, that began with ""if i left the zoo."" maybe i'm being unfair. perhaps i'm being too tough on them. their first two albums were such masterpieces that any subsequent releases were bound to be disappointments. but now that i think about it, no, i'm not being too rough with the chaps. jars began with similar musical roots to caedmon's call, and caedmon's has stayed strong and matured as a band, while jars has diverged onto the wide, well-traveled path of ccm mediocrity. lyrical shallowness kills this album, and just cannot satiate the depth of meaning required for a really great jars album. thus, i rate the cd a 2 o",t of 5

After the personal sounds and emotions on their self-titled debut, I fully expected to enjoy their return to more raw sounds after the experimentation of ""If I Left the Zoo"" (which I also enjoyed), but this album left me disappointed. It felt forced. They've grown up musically and the sound doesn't, and shouldn't, work for them anymore. Also, the lyrics of ""The Eleventh Hour"" didn't feel as personal and interesting as their earlier stuff and really felt distant from the music. Songs I really enjoyed included the title track, ""I Need You"", and ""The Scarlet Letter"". Nothing else really struck me. Bummer.",

Unfortunately I was wrong, and to boot, I accidently tossed the boxes in recycling so I can't return them. Decent concept with poor execution. You simply cannot tighten the clamp tight enough to hold a speaker over 5 pounds. I tightened them as tight as I could and within a few minutes the speakers were drooping.

It came with every thing I needed to hang my JBL ES20 bookshelf speakers for my surround sound system. Including the mounting plate that attaches to the speaker. The speakers weigh about 11 pounds and the mounts held very tightly. I was able dial everything in easily and quickly. ES20s are bare boned bookshelf speakers and do not have mounting capabilities. I would highly recommend this product. ""Word to the wise"" Anyone attempting to hang JBL ES20s, take great care to mount the plate to the speaker with 5/8 inch pan head screws.

I even took them apart to compare the one that worked with the one that did not. I could not see any difference. The nylon ball on the one kept slipping and within a few seconds my speaker would droop and end up pointed at the floor.

I used small piece of wire (i.e.. a coat hanger) cut to the proper length to use as support at the bottom of the speaker to keep it from sagging.

After one song, you can tell Common both loves being an m.c., and respects his position as an m.c. Something a lot of rappers forget to do. Also, the production on this cd is amazing. Almost every song is a masterpiece. Not since MC Solaar's Prose Combat have I heard an album so complete in both its lyricism and its production.

81964,__label__2,"Highly Insightful!: Scott Hafemann has done an excellent job in presenting a correct understanding of the Spirit/letter contrast in 2 Corinthians 3. The conclusion that he reaches has implications for a whole understanding of the Old Testament and the its relation to the New Testament. The essential message is this... The law was not inherently ""bad"" or oppression to the people of Israel. The problem resided with the people themselves. Only a remnant were true followers of Yahweh. For this faithful remnant, who had the Spirit operating in their lives, the law was good (cf. Psalm 119, et al). But for those without the Spirit (the majority of Israel), the law was simply ""letter"", and a burden. They did not want to keep it, nor could they. Seeing this helps us to understand both ""good"" and ""bad"" statements about the law in the NT writings.Hats off to Hafemann!",

It shows real-world applications of object oriented theory being applied to the .net framework.If you're a bit hazy on how OOP can apply to .net development, this is a good read.Its not really a reference... more of a book that will inspire a eureka! moment in new developers who are trying to square their academic education with real world languages.",

The tune that stands out for me is take it ez cause he just gets into a mad freestyle session. There are many others but this tune is true classic. 5 star LP nothing less.

""Take it Ez"" is my favorite track on the album, and it is the track that I feel represents old school hip-hop the best.

If you didn't get into Common until later, ""Can I Borrow A Dollar,"" might come as a bit of a suprise to you. In the beginning, even with the first single ""Take It Easy,"" Common seemed much more light hearted and comedic along the lines of The Pharcyde or Busta Rhymes. Musically, it was a good album and the second single ""Breaker 1-9"" got heavy rotation on The Box like the first single. If you are just getting into Common check this album out.",

Of course under load they are not quite as cool since the CPU is heating it up, but the water has ALWAYS been cooler than the water in my other liquid systems.I currently have this cooler on my CPU and an external Corsair Nautilus 500 system cooling my graphics card. Even overclocked a full Ghz over standard the CPU is at 84 degress F, 30 degrees C at idle. Under full load running Super PI or Orthos it will get up to 100-120 degrees F.

The robotic host however, quickly interupts with a follow up comment veiled poorly as a question, thus sealing this videos fate in my opinion.This video is a true stinker......
