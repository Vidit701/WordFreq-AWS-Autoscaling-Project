11202,232717,ROP,Roper Technologies  ROP  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Roper Technologies  NYSE ROP  reports results for the quarter ended December 2018  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  which is expected to be released on February 1  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This industrial equipment maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of  3 13 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  15 9  
Revenues are expected to be  1 35 billion  up 10 3  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Roper Technologies 
For Roper Technologies  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  4 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Roper Technologies will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Roper Technologies would post earnings of  2 94 per share when it actually produced earnings of  3 09  delivering a surprise of  5 10  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Roper Technologies doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-01-24,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/roper-technologies-rop-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200379530,200379530

In nearly every field all over the world  competition is part of daily existence  Little kids grow up keeping track of their games at recess  They then adopt a preferred team in their favorite sport and begin to root for winning seasons or even championships  The market in education is ultra competitive to enter the best schools  starting in high school and becoming even more fierce for college and graduate school  Competition in business is extreme in almost any industry and now extends all over the world 
Why does this matter to those of us looking for promising potential investments  The answer has to do with profitability  as the more competition  the harder it is to maintain a sustainable margin  The best example is what has happened to the general retail landscape with the emergence of Amazon com  The whole world knows to price check Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN  on nearly any item before buying  It used to be you checked Wal Mart  NYSE WMT  for the lowest price  Both have enormous scale and buy in such quantity to demand massive breaks from vendors  If you are Macy s  Kohl s  Penny s etc  the margin erosion battle is relentless 
It is a prime reason why I think you want to avoid these kinds of industries for long term investments  Instead  I think you are looking for situations with absence of competition  dominance  and above all  big margins  Margin  margin  margin  Easy to say  much harder to find  especially on a sustainable basis  Get hunting

Also in the deal world  Kraft Heinz  NASDAQ KHC  made a bid for Unilever  NYSE UN   which summarily turned down the  50 price offer  Let s take a closer look at this situation because it is quite interesting  although I am referring more to the corporate cultures versus the current market values 
Unilever is an enterprise where the bulk of its competitive advantage resides in emerging markets like India  Africa  Asia  and various parts of Europe  It is known as being very outspoken in favor of sustainable environmental practices and have incorporated this ethos throughout its systems  particularly the supply chain  You could call it one of the leaders of the ethically conscious corporation movement  Kraft  its pursuer  was a spin off of  drum roll please  Phillip Morris  In case you aren t familiar with PM  that would be the largest provider of tobacco related products  you know  cigarettes 
Uh  that might be a little issue with the rank at file at Unilever  right  Well  the largest owner of Kraft Heinz is 3G Capital  who has a big partner named Berkshire Hathaway  NYSE BRKa   led by  Warren Buffett  Berkshire also is the second largest owner of Kraft as well  So  with Buffet sitting on 100 billion in cash at Berkshire  it could be used to help finance the deal  Of course  the brass at Unilever turned down the 50 buck offer  but 3G is well known for it s  shall we say  tenacity  Having owned Unilever for over a decade  I suspect their management team is not keen to be taken over by Kraft  Get the popcorn out because this one is worth watching

US Hotel Industry Holding Up Well Despite Global Headwinds

	The U S  hotel industry cycle appears to be moderating to historical norms  coming off years of accelerated growth that started in 2010 following the Great Recession 

	On the one hand  apart from softening occupancy levels  negative currency translation  pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown raise concerns  On the other  a steady rise in business and leisure travel on the back of an improving economy and positive employment numbers along with strong investor appetite thanks to higher transaction volumes is spreading cheer across the industry 

	Going forward  we expect that the lodging cycle will align with the broader business cycle  Moreover  hoteliers have been moving from owning real estate to franchising their brands and services to counter economic volatility better 

	Does this mean that the hotel industry is a bowl of cherries  Not really 

What s Hurting the Hoteliers 

	Hoteliers have been focusing on renovation and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on growing tourism numbers  However  to do that  the steep costs incurred by leading hoteliers are taking a toll on profits  Further  online travel agents like Expedia Inc   Nasdaq    andThe Priceline Group Inc   Nasdaq     are limiting the pricing power of these brands 

	Meanwhile  the slowdown in China  lingering uncertainty in various international markets  and increased supply are likely to continue to pose headwinds  Particularly in Europe  economic political conditions are expected to be challenging post Brexit 

	Another major threat comes from home sharing companies  like Airbnb  Inc   which offer a digital service allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations  With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with  these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants like Marriott International  Inc   Nasdaq     

The Positives

	Nonetheless  as per the most recent forecast from Smith Travel Research  STR   a leading information and data provider for the lodging industry and Tourism Economics  the U S  hotel industry is projected to experience continued growth through 2017  albeit at a slower rate 

	For full year 2016  the U S  hotel industry is predicted to report flat occupancy growth  and a 3 2  rise in average daily rate  ADR   Revenue per available room  RevPAR  is also anticipated to go up 3 2   with higher ADR being the key RevPAR growth driver 

	Moreover  the Baird STR Hotel Stock Index  which comprises 20 of the largest market capitalization hotel companies publicly traded on a U S  exchange and attempts to characterize the performance of hotel stocks  is up 0 4  year to date 

	Additionally  according to STR  RevPAR at U S  hotels was up 5  year over year for the week ended Nov 12  2016 

	Thus  as hoteliers strive to enhance value and competitiveness  industry best practices such as sustainability  brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking   especially among the millennials   will remain the priorities 

	Meanwhile  Marriott s acquisition of Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc  is being viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home sharing companies  Other hoteliers like Hyatt Hotels Corp   NYSE    andWyndham Worldwide Corp   NYSE     are also investing in home sharing start ups to combat Airbnb 

	Notably  all the three companies    Marriott  Hyatt and Wyndham  carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see   

Zacks Industry Rank   Neutral Outlook

	Within the Zacks Industry classification  we rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry  To learn more visit   

	As a guideline  the outlook for industries in the top 1 3rd of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of  88 and lower is  Positive   the middle 1 3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between  89 and  176 is  Neutral  and the bottom 1 3rd or Zacks Industry Rank of  177 and higher is  Negative  

	The Zacks Industry Rank for the Hotels   Motels industry is currently  156  This puts the industry in the middle third of all industries  corresponding to a neutral outlook 

Earnings Trends

	The Hotels   Motels industry falls under the broader Consumer Discretionary sector 

	As of Nov 17  94 3  of the Consumer Discretionary companies in the S P 500 index reported their Q3 results  The growth rate for earnings and revenues is 7 6  and 12 2   respectively  Moreover  the beat ratios for this sector are noteworthy  72 7  for earnings and 45 5  for revenues  

	Meanwhile  for 2016  both earnings and revenues for the sector are expected to rise 4 8  and 12 1   respectively 

	However  most of the hoteliers  top line growth was weaker than expectedin the third quarter 2016 earnings season and showed sequential RevPAR growth deceleration 

	For more details about earnings for this sector and others  please read our     report 

Conclusion

	On the whole  though pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown continue to weigh on sentiment  hoteliers are cautiously optimistic heading into 2017

Demand Supply Gap  The recovery in the broader economy has been a boon for the hotel industry as it has perked up leisure and transient business travel demand  According to Hyatt Hotels Corporation  H  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   HLT   the supply demand environment in the U S  is favorable  We note that demand growth in the U S  has outpaced supply growth each year since 2010 
Meanwhile  though the gap between demand growth and supply growth continues to narrow and occupancy growth has slowed  higher rates are expected to keep driving revenue per available room  RevPAR   Considering the long pipeline of hotels  Smith Travel Research  STR  expects the sector s demand and supply growth to be equal at 1 6  in the U S  in 2016 
International Expansion  Major hoteliers are exploring growth opportunities abroad  especially in the emerging markets and the outlying areas surrounding major cities  Despite macroeconomic concerns in several emerging economies  hoteliers are forging ahead with expansion plans in markets with great long term potential 
A number of U S  based hoteliers are targeting the unsaturated markets in Asia Pacific  the Middle East  Brazil  Russia and Africa  Within Asia  China promises lucrative growth opportunities  despite the economic slowdown  with visits expected to increase substantially  moving ahead  In fact  China is the fastest growing lodging market in the world  Interestingly  the country is a major revenue contributor for Marriott International  Inc   MAR  
Apart from China  India is becoming a hot spot for U S  based hoteliers with its emergence as a global business hub  Although economic growth rates are slightly lower than China  the country has great long term growth potential as a tourism market  Among others  Japan  Australia  Singapore and Thailand continue to attract travelers  The key players in the industry are also targeting the high potential Middle East countries such as Turkey and United Arab Emirates  UAE  that offer strong infrastructure 
Meanwhile  Europe remains an attractive market for hoteliers despite repeated terror attacks and Brexit induced uncertainties  Major players like Marriott  Hilton  Choice Hotels International Inc   CHH  and Wyndham Worldwide  NYSE WYN  Corporation  WYN  have a strong foothold in this region 
Brand Renovation to Boost Growth  Hotel chains are meticulously working on guest satisfaction via brand conversion and re modeling to gain a competitive advantage  Remodeling mostly involves restoration of lobbies and other public spaces  preservation of decorative features if possible  and guestroom upgrades to make the brand more relevant  In fact  brand perception is likely to have a growing influence on the mass market as well as luxury space  With the market becoming increasingly saturated  especially the luxury segment  hotels will have to differentiate themselves 
Brands that can offer something uniquely compelling are likely to grab market share and thus the ability to innovate will be their key to success  Therefore  ace hoteliers like Marriott  Belmond Ltd   BEL  and Hyatt are firing on all cylinders to sync their brands to the order of the day  All these companies carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Moreover  in recent times  brand development is being shaped not only by economic trends  but also by millennials  tastes  It is Gen Y that constitutes a major portion of the current tourism numbers and their tastes and expectations are widely different from their preceding generations  According to players in the hospitality sector  eco awareness  wellness and brand distinctiveness are important themes for this generation  Big hotel brands are thus launching more lifestyle hotels  which are mainly boutique brands that benefit from parent companies  infrastructure  These include brands like Marriott s Element  Aloft and Edition  Andaz by Hyatt  and InterContinental Hotels Group s  IHG  Hotel Indigo 
Loyalty Programs  In order to survive in a tough economic environment  hoteliers are continuously devising newer ways to enhance guest experience and raise occupancy  and offering of loyalty programs is one of them  Thus  hoteliers have been increasingly focusing on their loyalty programs as rewards members stay longer than nonmembers and also generate more in revenue for their franchisees 
Notably  Wyndham Rewards offers one of the most generous reward program payouts in the industry  Recently  management announced that Wyndham would be the first hospitality company to globally expand the use of its loyalty program across vacation ownership and vacation rental properties  Meanwhile  post its acquisition of Starwood  Marriott linked industry leading guest loyalty programs   Marriott Rewards  Ritz Carlton Rewards  and Starwood Preferred Guest   and announced the matching of member status between the programs  The company believes that the linking of the three loyalty programs would lead to an even larger loyalty community 
Loyalty programs are thus the key to better brand experience and hoteliers are continuously reengineering these to provide a more fulfilling experience 
Embracing Social Media and Smartphone Technology to Build Loyalty  In today s world of price comparison and shared economy  hotels have to constantly push their boundaries to retain customers  In this regard  digital innovation and social media have started to play a key role  Social media can enhance a brand s prospects by connecting directly with guests  especially millennials and can  in turn  increase loyalty and market share  Social media sites like Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Inc   FB   Twitter  Inc   TWTR  and TripAdvisor Inc  NASDAQ TRIP    TRIP  are commonly used by travelers to select hotels  Moreover  hoteliers are using apps to help guests manage bookings and are offering interactive maps GPS to increase occupancy 
In fact  according to Navis  a leading innovative hospitality technology solution provider   which quoted eMarketer s estimates of digital and travel research and booking   51 8  of travelers who book trips digitally in 2016 will do so through a mobile device  This is a sharp uptick from 43 8  in 2015 and highlights the importance of smartphones in online travel 
In fact  mobile check ins and check outs have increased substantially over the past two years as the service is helping guests to use their smart devices to connect with the hotel for faster and seamless check in check out  Hoteliers are therefore looking to introduce responsive designs in their apps  one click booking  and location technology to improve operating efficiencies and enhance guest services  Being tech savvy is thus no longer an option but a necessity to survive in the intensely competitive hotel industry 
Many hotel companies are also setting up analytics tools to understand consumer preferences   and deliver a differentiated experience   which could eventually motivate customers to visit frequently  stay longer and spend more 
Bottom Line
The lodging sector will prove to be a worthy investment proposition in the near  to medium term provided the economy continues to shows signs of recovery  This in turn will perk up investor confidence and lead to greater demand  thereby boosting hoteliers  profitability

11217,232732,WYND,What Worries Shareholders In The Hotel Industry ,opinion,"Granted  sales have been pretty solid in the U S  and emerging markets have great growth prospects  Still  it would be prudent to take a closer look at some of the dampeners before investing in the hotel industry  Particularly  macroeconomic concerns in several emerging economies could spoil the party for hoteliers 
Below  we discuss some of the headwinds that hotel stocks may face in the near as well as the long term 
Lingering Uncertainty in Certain International Markets  Despite immense growth potential  hoteliers are still apprehensive of several macroeconomic issues in international markets  like the social political impact of the unexpected   Brexit   vote and decelerating growth in certain parts of Asia 
Moreover  a sluggish economy in Brazil is weighing on demand in the Latin American region and has checked overall sales  In fact  Brazil  Argentina and Ecuador have witnessed a decline in hotel occupancy so far in 2016  The weak Latin American economy  aggravated by political turmoil thus led to softer tourism numbers in 2015  which continues in 2016 
Meanwhile  hoteliers like Marriott International  Inc   MAR  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   HLT  expect pandemic virus like Zika to continue to temper growth in the Caribbean region 
In Europe  economic political conditions are expected to be challenging after U K  s exit from the 28 member economic bloc  Business in Europe is as it is clouded by economic uncertainties in the Northern region and deflation in the Eurozone 
Recent terror assaults on key European cities like London  Paris and Brussels have also affected tourism numbers  The attacks in Brussels dealt a severe blow to Europe s tourism industry  just as it was going into the peak season with hopes of a turnaround from the canceled bookings that followed the Paris attacks last year  Further  concerns of further terror attacks and violence against foreign tourists are increasingly hurting trade in many African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria 
If this wasn t enough  the slowing down of the Chinese economy and concerns over Japan  owing to a weaker yen and tax increases  are adding to hoteliers  woes  Notably  China s economic growth rate moderated in recent times with its 2015 GDP growth touching a 25 year low  The slowdown in the Chinese economy is thus hurting discretionary spending and  in turn  travel 
Meanwhile  the Middle East and Africa has seen a decline in international arrivals due to a drop in oil prices and increase in security concerns  political unrest and rising supply  adding to the woes of hoteliers 
Slowing RevPar Trends  Most of the hoteliers in the U S  have been witnessing slowing revenue per available room  RevPAR  trends of late  because of continued muted international visitation along with new supply impact 
In fact  taking into account the impact of a weaker global macro outlook  Marriott lowered its comparable system wide RevPAR expectations on a constant dollar basis to growth of 3  in North America  outside North America and worldwide for full year 2016  Notably  the company had earlier guided for RevPAR growth of 3  to 5  
Moreover  the majority of leading hoteliers expect soft demand in the oil producing regions  which mainly include parts of Texas  Houston  Louisiana  Houston  Oklahoma City and West Virginia to continue hurting RevPAR 
Fluctuation in Exchange Rates  Most of the major hoteliers like Marriott  Hyatt Hotels Corporation  H  and Wyndham Worldwide  NYSE WYN  Corporation  WYN  generate a substantial portion of their revenues from customers outside the U S  Notably  all these companies carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see  
Hence  any unfavorable change in currency may hurt their financials to a great extent  Though the dollar weakened slightly in 2016 compared to the previous year  the negative currency impact is still significant  Meanwhile  Marriott and Wyndham are bearing the brunt of Venezuelan currency devaluation as well 
Thus  such volatility in exchange rates would continue to hurt the results of hoteliers as it has been doing so over the past few quarters 
Operating Margins Under Pressure  Operating margins for the hoteliers are yet to reach the industry peak of 2007 in the U S  due to a spike in costs  Hoteliers are looking to differentiate themselves and keep up with changing consumer tastes through investments in technology  quick customer service and real time marketing  These are denting margins even further  Additionally  most hoteliers plan to gain a competitive advantage and differentiate their brands through renovation  This comes at the cost of near term margins 
Additionally  online booking sites like Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE    EXPE  and The Priceline Group s  PCLN  Booking com are limiting the pricing power of these hotels  which are contracting their margins  The higher commission rates charged on hotels are also hurting margins  Meanwhile  with lower overhead costs and less stricter regulations than hotel companies  home sharing companies like Airbnb  Inc  are also seizing share away from traditional players 
Healthcare Reforms to Hurt Profitability  The Affordable Care Act  commonly known as Obamacare  is expected to have an adverse impact on hoteliers  margins  The law entails hotels with 100 or more full time equivalent employees to offer healthcare coverage to nearly all full time employees and their dependents beginning this year  Also  from 2016  employers with 50 to 99 full time equivalent employees have also been included under Obamacare  Employers will be suffering penalties for any non compliance  This would continue to raise costs for hoteliers in the near term 
To Conclude
Although various geopolitical   economic woes are threatening RevPar growth in the hotel industry  it remains to be seen whether improving economy and efforts undertaken by hoteliers to increase occupancy can offset these negatives 
Let us see how these companies fare and register profits in the coming days  In    we focused on the conditions which are expected to drive the industry forward

Disappointing Metrics
STR data for October 2016 indicates that occupancy rates are down In Europe  Middle East and Central South America  Asia and the U S  were flattish 
As far as the average daily rate  ADR  or  pricing   is concerned  there were declines everywhere except in the Americas 
Revenue per average room  revPAR  also wasn t encouraging  declining in Europe  Middle East and Central South America but flattish in Asia and up 1 9  in the U S 
From the above  it appears that the domestic market is the best place to search for growth  But according to STR s updated outlook for 2016 and 2017  things could be turning for the worse  The firm says that while growth in supply and demand will be in equilibrium in 2016 at 1 6   demand will decelerate slightly to 1 5  next year with supply accelerating to 2 0  
The occupancy rate will go from flat to down 0 5   The supply demand mismatch will also impact pricing for hoteliers  As a result  ADR growth will go from 3 1  to 2 8   also impacting the RevPAR    
The numbers indicate that demand is not about to get stronger  And indeed  2017 estimates for some hoteliers are trending down  Mariott for example saw a 6 cent decline in the last 30 days  with Hilton down 8 cents and Expedia down 18 cents  Other estimates can also start trending down in the coming days 
Is It All Bad News 
While growth isn t expected to accelerate in the near term  the domestic market and China Asia are likely to be moderately positive  So people already invested in the space may want to hang on  Here s some more data that investors with a longer investment horizon may cheer at 
According to Director General and CEO of the International Air Transport Association  IATA   Alexandre de Juniac   September s growth in passenger demand was healthy  Importantly  this rebound from August weakness suggests that travel demand is showing its resilience in the aftermath of terror attacks 
 We must  of course  be ever alert to the ongoing terror threat  And overall the industry is still vulnerable to being buffeted by rising geopolitical tensions  protectionist political agendas  and weak economic fundamentals  This will still be a good year for the airline industry s performance  but our profitability will continue to be hard won  
Investors can find opportunities in both the fastest growing countries of China and India 
In China  there is a restriction on foreign ownership of aircraft and airports  But investment opportunity exists as parts suppliers to aircraft companies and designers of airports according to Dezan Shira and Associates 
The opportunity in India is opening up with the Modi government publishing the country s first ever Civil Aviation Policy allowing the privatization of airlines and up to 100  FDI in Indian airlines companies among other things  But the segment is necessarily heavily regulated because of its relation to national security and also heavily taxed  There is also mounting pressure for India to join the International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO  that seeks to get member countries to offset the environmental impact of future air traffic growth  India has managed to stay out of this to date  if it decides to join  there can be cost escalation 
Travel can be for both business and leisure although a recent study from Priceline says that people are generally more open to mix the two these days  i e  extend the business trip to enjoy the destination 
Also  McKinsey finds that business travel in Asia is rather different from other parts of the world  The world s biggest business travel market with a 38  share worth a trillion dollars in annual spending is characterized by greater choice to individual travelers 
On the basis of a survey of 2 500 business travelers in China  India  Indonesia  Japan and Singapore and interviews of 19 corporate travel managers  the study finds that 69  of respondents are able to choose their airlines  either from a preapproved list or without restrictions of which 11  have no constraints on either provider or price  Similarly  74  of respondents said they have the same degree of freedom in picking a hotel  of which 9  said they have no restrictions whatsoever 
On the other hand  companies at times incentivize employees to accept cheaper travel options  So the distinction between business and leisure type travel is less evident here  Business travelers in Asia generally prefer convenience over all else and are therefore very inclined to order online using mobile devices and through online booking agents 
According to the latest Visa sponsored GBTA BTI Outlook   China 2016 H1  China has overtaken the U S  as the largest business travel market in the world  Moreover  it is also one of the fastest growing  10 1  growth in 2016 followed by 9 8  growth in 2017   Domestic spend is 95  of total spend  The report also mentions the estimated U S  growth rate for 2016 of 1 9  
The GBTA BTI Outlook   India report says that the country is currently the 10th largest business travel market in the world  forecasted to grow 10 7  this year and 10 2  in 2017 and assume the sixth position by 2019  Domestic spending will grow 11 5  and 10 3  in 2016 and 2017  respectively  Outbound travel will be slower  growing a respective 3 1  and 9 0

11220,232735,WYND,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Marriott  Hilton  Priceline  Expedia And Southwest,opinion,"For Immediate Release

	Chicago  IL   November 29  2016   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include Marriott  NASDAQ     Hilton  NYSE     Priceline  NASDAQ     Expedia  NASDAQ EXPE   NASDAQ     and Southwest  NYSE      

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Monday s Analyst Blog  

Avoid Travel Stocks for Now

	By travel stocks I mean hotel stocks like Marriott  NASDAQ      Hilton  NYSE      and  Wyndham Worldwide  NYSE WYN   online hotel booking companies like Priceline  NASDAQ     and Expedia  NASDAQ        recommendation sites like TripAdvisor and other players facilitating or indirectly involved in the travel business 

	The segment has suffered the brunt of terror attacks  Brexit uncertainties and the stronger dollar  which combined to contain hotel demand for much of the year  The question  then  is whether the weakness will continue  for these or other reasons   or is it time to look beyond these issues to more positive indicators perhaps 

	Another segment that benefits from travel demand is airlines and as it turns out  companies like Southwest  NYSE      also share the terror and Brexit issues  They are also saddled with rising labor costs and declining air fares 

	Low oil prices have been a positive  however    on the one hand increasing consumer disposable income  and on the other supporting airlines profitability  It s a different matter that capacity additions seem high in response to the rising demand  which is impacting air fares 

Disappointing Metrics

	STR data for October 2016 indicates that occupancy rates are down In Europe  Middle East and Central South America  Asia and the U S  were flattish 

	As far as the average daily rate  ADR  or  pricing   is concerned  there were declines everywhere except in the Americas 

	Revenue per average room  revPAR  also wasn t encouraging  declining in Europe  Middle East and Central South America but flattish in Asia and up 1 9  in the U S 

	From the above  it appears that the domestic market is the best place to search for growth  But according to STR s updated outlook for 2016 and 2017  things could be turning for the worse  The firm says that while growth in supply and demand will be in equilibrium in 2016 at 1 6   demand will decelerate slightly to 1 5  next year with supply accelerating to 2 0  

	The occupancy rate will go from flat to down 0 5   The supply demand mismatch will also impact pricing for hoteliers  As a result  ADR growth will go from 3 1  to 2 8   also impacting the RevPAR 

	The numbers indicate that demand is not about to get stronger  And indeed  2017 estimates for some hoteliers are trending down  Mariott for example saw a 6 cent decline in the last 30 days  with Hilton down 8 cents and Expedia down 18 cents  Other estimates can also start trending down in the coming days 

Is It All Bad News 

	While growth isn t expected to accelerate in the near term  the domestic market and China Asia are likely to be moderately positive  So people already invested in the space may want to hang on  Here s some more data that investors with a longer investment horizon may cheer at 

	According to Director General and CEO of the International Air Transport Association  IATA   Alexandre de Juniac   September s growth in passenger demand was healthy  Importantly  this rebound from August weakness suggests that travel demand is showing its resilience in the aftermath of terror attacks 

	 We must  of course  be ever alert to the ongoing terror threat  And overall the industry is still vulnerable to being buffeted by rising geopolitical tensions  protectionist political agendas  and weak economic fundamentals  This will still be a good year for the airline industry s performance  but our profitability will continue to be hard won  

	Investors can find opportunities in both the fastest growing countries of China and India 

	In China  there is a restriction on foreign ownership of aircraft and airports  But investment opportunity exists as parts suppliers to aircraft companies and designers of airports according to Dezan Shira and Associates 

	The opportunity in India is opening up with the Modi government publishing the country s first ever Civil Aviation Policy allowing the privatization of airlines and up to 100  FDI in Indian airlines companies among other things  But the segment is necessarily heavily regulated because of its relation to national security and also heavily taxed  There is also mounting pressure for India to join the International Civil Aviation Organization  ICAO  that seeks to get member countries to offset the environmental impact of future air traffic growth  India has managed to stay out of this to date  if it decides to join  there can be cost escalation 

	Travel can be for both business and leisure although a recent study from Priceline says that people are generally more open to mix the two these days  i e  extend the business trip to enjoy the destination 

	Also  McKinsey finds that business travel in Asia is rather different from other parts of the world  The world s biggest business travel market with a 38  share worth a trillion dollars in annual spending is characterized by greater choice to individual travelers 

	On the basis of a survey of 2 500 business travelers in China  India  Indonesia  Japan and Singapore and interviews of 19 corporate travel managers  the study finds that 69  of respondents are able to choose their airlines  either from a preapproved list or without restrictions of which 11  have no constraints on either provider or price  Similarly  74  of respondents said they have the same degree of freedom in picking a hotel  of which 9  said they have no restrictions whatsoever 

	On the other hand  companies at times incentivize employees to accept cheaper travel options  So the distinction between business and leisure type travel is less evident here  Business travelers in Asia generally prefer convenience over all else and are therefore very inclined to order online using mobile devices and through online booking agents 

	According to the latest Visa sponsored GBTA BTI Outlook   China 2016 H1  China has overtaken the U S  as the largest business travel market in the world  Moreover  it is also one of the fastest growing  10 1  growth in 2016 followed by 9 8  growth in 2017   Domestic spend is 95  of total spend  The report also mentions the estimated U S  growth rate for 2016 of 1 9  

	The GBTA BTI Outlook   India report says that the country is currently the 10th largest business travel market in the world  forecasted to grow 10 7  this year and 10 2  in 2017 and assume the sixth position by 2019  Domestic spending will grow 11 5  and 10 3  in 2016 and 2017  respectively  Outbound travel will be slower  growing a respective 3 1  and 9 0  

	According to the Visa sponsored GBTA BTI Outlook   Western Europe  the region will see 6 3  growth in 2016 followed by 6 8  growth in 2017  Germany leads the region and in addition to the UK  will see higher growth rates

	The travel market has few good opportunities at the moment  Instead see      But it isn t all doom and gloom either  If you re in the segment for the longer term  it makes sense to hold on  But this isn t the time to make fresh investments and a wait and see approach to Asian opportunities may be a good idea

11221,232736,WYND,Hotel Industry Stock Outlook   November 2016,opinion,"US Hotel Industry Holding Up Well Despite Global Headwinds
The U S  hotel industry cycle appears to be moderating to historical norms  coming off years of accelerated growth that started in 2010 following the Great Recession 
On the one hand  apart from softening occupancy levels  negative currency translation  pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown raise concerns  On the other  a steady rise in business and leisure travel on the back of an improving economy and positive employment numbers along with strong investor appetite thanks to higher transaction volumes is spreading cheer across the industry 
Going forward  we expect that the lodging cycle will align with the broader business cycle  Moreover  hoteliers have been moving from owning real estate to franchising their brands and services to counter economic volatility better 
Does this mean that the hotel industry is a bowl of cherries  Not really 
What s Hurting the Hoteliers 
Hoteliers have been focusing on renovation and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on growing tourism numbers  However  to do that  the steep costs incurred by leading hoteliers are taking a toll on profits  Further  online travel agents like Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE    EXPE   TripAdvisor  TRIP  and The Priceline Group Inc   PCLN  are limiting the pricing power of these brands 
Meanwhile  the slowdown in China  lingering uncertainty in various international markets  and increased supply are likely to continue to pose headwinds  Particularly in Europe  economic political conditions are expected to be challenging post Brexit 
Another major threat comes from home sharing companies  like Airbnb  Inc   which offer a digital service allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations  With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with  these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing share from giants like Marriott International  Inc   MAR  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   HLT  
The Positives
Nonetheless  as per the most recent forecast fromSmith Travel Research  STR   a leading information and data provider for the lodging industry and Tourism Economics  the U S  hotel industry is projected to experience continued growth through 2017  albeit at a slower rate 
For full year 2016  the U S  hotel industry is predicted to report flat occupancy growth  and a 3 2  rise in average daily rate  ADR   Revenue per available room  RevPAR  is also anticipated to go up 3 2   with higher ADR being the key RevPAR growth driver 
Moreover  the Baird STR Hotel Stock Index  which comprises 20 of the largest market capitalization hotel companies publicly traded on a U S  exchange and attempts to characterize the performance of hotel stocks  is up 0 4  year to date 
Additionally  according to STR  RevPAR at U S  hotels was up 5  year over year for the week ended Nov 12  2016 
Thus  as hoteliers strive to enhance value and competitiveness  industry best practices such as sustainability  brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking   especially among the millennials   will remain the priorities 
Meanwhile  Marriott s acquisition of Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc  is being viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home sharing companies  Other hoteliers like Hyatt Hotels Corp   H  and Wyndham Worldwide Corp  NYSE WYN    WYN  are also investing in home sharing start ups to combat Airbnb 
Notably  all the three companies    Marriott  Hyattand Wyndham  carry a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   You can see

Earnings Trends

Meanwhile  for 2016  both earnings and revenues for the sector are expected to rise 4 8  and 12 1   respectively 
However  most of the hoteliers  top line growth was weaker than expectedin the third quarter 2016 earnings season and showed sequential RevPAR growth deceleration

Conclusion
On the whole  though pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown continue to weigh on sentiment  hoteliers are cautiously optimistic heading into 2017

11224,232739,ROP,5 Top Stocks To Gain From Escalating Trade War Tensions,opinion,U S  President Trump has threatened to impose further tariffs on Chinese goods  while Beijing warned it would retaliate  This has heightened the trade spat between the two of the world s largest economies  Investors  naturally  have turned nervous as earnings of companies could be at risk in the event of a global trade war But there are some companies that might benefit  Among these are producers of goods that do limited business in China  have solid growth narratives and their promising outlook remains unfazed by the change in tariffs  Thus  investing in such winners at times of a trade war will not be a bad proposition Trump Ups the Stake in Trade WarThe chances of a trade clash between Washington and Beijing intensified after Trump instructed the U S  Trade Representative s office to figure out  200 billion in imports from China for additional tariffs of 10   He added that the United States may impose tariffs on another  200 billion provided the Asian nation retaliates Last week  Trump threatened to impose a 25  tariff on  50 billion Chinese imports  The tariffs will be passed in two phases  More than 800 Chinese exports  worth  34 billion  will be subject to tariffs beginning in July and another 280 or so will go through a public comment period and take effect later Trump said that  the United States will no longer be taken advantage of on trade by China and other countries in the world  and that the U S   will continue using all available tools to create a better and fairer trading system for all Americans  The tariffs are intended to force China change its unfair practices with respect to technology and innovation  But regrettably China is hell bent on increasing its tariffs on  50 billion worth of U S  exports  read more    Global Fund Managers Turn to AlibabaTrade wars are headwinds for companies as these erode profit margins and affect the overall economy  Thus  this rising tension has compelled top fund managers to look for companies that can emerge as winners  These companies have a strong domestic business and are unperturbed by import tariffs or in other words have a dominant market position George Maris  a portfolio manager of the  2 2 billion Janus Henderson Global Select fund has identified one such company  That is none other than Chinese e commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Limited   NYSE BABA    primarily  because of its domestic exposure The company s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 26 7  compared with the  industry s estimated rally of 12 3   The company has also outperformed the industry in the last year   50 7  compared with  49 1   Google  Facebook   Axon Enterprise Undeterred by a Trade WarCompanies that have long term growth narrative will also not be affected by a trade war  Notable  among them are Alphabet Inc    NASDAQ GOOGL    Facebook  Inc    NASDAQ FB   and Axon Enterprise  Inc    NASDAQ AAXN    Google s growth is dependent on an uptick in digital advertising  since the search engine controls more than 40  of the U S  digital ad market  Google s focus on smart home technology  cloud data centers and automated driving drives the company s earnings  All these areas are unlikely to be affected by a trade war        Similarly  Facebook s growth is mostly in digital advertising  Facebook controls 20  of the U S  digital ad market  while Instagram controls another 5   Needless to say that digital advertising industry is hardly affected by the implementation of tariffs Axon Enterprise sells an array of digital solutions including cloud data storage systems and mobile video apps to law enforcement agencies throughout the world  Such agencies are in desperate need of a technology makeover  which gives the stock a solid growth narrative In fact  shares of Alphabet  Facebook and Axon Enterprise rose 2 1   1 3  and 2 7  on Jun 18  respectively despite Trump s threat to escalate the trade fight with China Why Thinking Small is Not the Only Thing to Do Now In the wake of Trump s tariff announcement  investors seem to be shifting into small cap stocks  And why so  This is because such stocks tend to have higher proportion of domestic sales compared to large caps  But  in reality  the difference isn t much  Per data from FactSet Research  small caps stocks in the Russell 2000 index derive 20 6  of their revenues from outside the United States  while stocks from the broader S P 500 derive 30 3  Satellite player Harris  electrical equipment maker Hubbell  seller of lighting equipment Acuity Brands  aerospace and defense players KLX and L3 Technologies  Inc    NYSE LLL    conglomerate Roper Technologies  Inc    NYSE ROP    and factory control specialist Rockwell Automation  NYSE ROK  derive a meagre 10  of revenues from China  per UBS Goldman stated that CSX Corporation   NASDAQ CSX    CVS Health Corp  NYSE CVS   Dollar General Corp  NYSE DG   Public Storage  NYSE PSA   Verizon Communications Inc  NYSE VZ  and Wells Fargo  NYSE WFC  derive 100  of their sales from the United States  Intuit Inc    NASDAQ INTU   is another company that derives 95  of its sales from the country  Goldman added  Hence  it s quite natural that these companies stand to gain the most as trade war escalates  After all  their profits aren t getting eroded due to limited exposure to foreign markets 5 Solid ChoicesThus  investing in the aforesaid stocks as the specter of a global trade war looms seems prudent  We have selected five stocks that carry a Zacks

11225,232740,ROP,U S  China Trade Spat Hits Fever Pitch  Top   Flop Stocks,opinion,"President Trump has threatened to expand tariffs on Chinese goods  which many fear will trigger a Chinese harassment of U S  businesses  The trade spat between the two countries did take a toll on the iPhone maker  semiconductors  industrial behemoths  steel producers and automobiles But  the same cannot be said about defensive players  regional producers and companies with strong growth narratives  Shares of such companies easily bucked the sharply negative tone of the broader market           Trade Tensions SurgeTrump caught China off guard with his announcement of new tariffs  If China retaliates against U S  trade policies  then the White House would impose tariffs of 10  on additional  400 billion of Chinese imports  White House senior trade adviser Peter Navarro and U S  trade representative Robert Lighthizer argue that the Trump administration took this tough stance as China represents a fundamental threat to the United States in terms of technology and innovation China  unfortunately  remained hell bent on increasing its tariffs on  50 billion worth of U S  exports and accused the United States for ratcheting a trade war  The Chinese Ministry of Commerce also pledged to apply qualitative retaliatory tactics  Mark Zandi  chief economist at Moody s Analytics added that  the qualitative thing they could do  would be to  devalue the currency   that would be even more extreme   to offset the impact of the tariffs on their products  Tariff tantrums and the prospect of a

under tremendous pressure this year so far  partly due to rise in bond yields  But as the markets are plagued by trade related uncertainty  defensive stocks are moving north  After all  such stocks are generally non cyclical  or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with the activities in the broader market  Their products are in constant demand irrespective of market volatility and such names include companies from utilities and consumer staples Utilities are deemed defensive stocks as electricity  gas and water are essentials  Food  beverage and tobacco companies are true defensive plays as demand for such staple stocks remains unaltered during market gyrations A notable company from the   CenterPoint Energy  Inc  s   NYSE CNP   expected growth rate

Outlet also carries a Zacks Rank  2 Domestic Producers Outperform MultinationalsDespite escalating trade concerns  domestic producers remain fairly immune  This is because such stocks have high domestic exposure in terms of revenue generation  which shields them from the aftermath of international disputes  On the contrary  trade issues are headwinds for bigwigs as these erode overseas profits One such domestic player as per Goldman is Roper Technologies  Inc    NYSE ROP    The conglomerate derives a meagre 10  of revenues from China  The company s expected growth rate for the

though  are bearing the brunt of escalating trade tensions  Notable  among them are Alphabet  NASDAQ GOOGL  Inc   Facebook  NASDAQ FB  and Axon Enterprise  Inc    NYSE X    This is because their long term growth narrative will not be affected by a trade war  And why so  Google s growth is dependent on an uptick in digital advertising  while Facebook s growth is also mostly in digital advertising space  Needless to say that digital advertising industry is hardly affected by the implementation of tariffs Axon Enterprise  in the meantime  sells an array of digital solutions including cloud data storage systems and mobile video apps to law enforcement agencies throughout the world  Such agencies are in desperate need of a technology makeover  which gives the stock a solid growth narrative and

11227,232742,ROP,Roper Tech  Best Performing Dividend Aristocrat For Past 2 Decades ,opinion,"Roper Technologies Inc  NYSE ROP  has been the best performing Dividend Aristocrat over the last couple of decades  However  Roper is not your typical dividend growth stock  In fact  in many ways I believe the company is better thought of as a growth stock  Nevertheless  growth is a great asset to possess in every investor s toolbox  Thanks to the power of compounding  it s hard to lose money over the long run when investing in a consistent above average grower  Roper Technologies Inc  is a classic example 
In the FAST Graphs analyze out loud video below  I will provide a by the numbers look at Roper Technologies Inc s fundamentals  My objective will be to clearly illustrate where and how its performance has been generated  Although this is not a household name  it s a very interesting company that turns most of its operating cash flow into free cash flow thereby providing it a consistent engine for growth 
Measuring Performance without Simultaneously Measuring Valuation Is a Job Half Done
Dividend Aristocrats are typically thought of as superior dividend income generators  However  many of them have also outperformed the S P 500 on a capital appreciation basis as well  Since the beginning of 1999  approximately 75  of the Dividend Aristocrats have outperformed the market over the long run solely on a capital appreciation basis  However  100  of the Dividend Aristocrats have outperformed the S P 500 on a total dividend income paid basis over that time frame  Therefore  it should be obvious that high quality blue chip dividend paying stocks tend to be better than average long term investments 
Moreover  from a total return perspective  there are numerous Dividend Aristocrats that have produced double digit total returns since 1999  while the S P 500 has only averaged a 6  annualized total return  However  Roper Technologies Inc  has outperformed all others by a significant margin  On the other hand  this best performing Dividend Aristocrat also offers the lowest current yield than any of its counterparts  Perhaps even more interestingly  this Dividend Aristocrat has been one of the fastest growing  but not the fastest growing Aristocrat 
The point I m driving at is that when evaluating performance  it s very important to recognize and understand precisely how that performance was generated  Over the years as a value investor  I have emphatically stated many times   measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done  
Over normal times  or when the market is behaving rationally  long term performance will primarily be a function of how well the business performs on an operating basis  In other words  there is an indisputable long term correlation between business results and stock price movements  Additionally  if the company pays a dividend  dividends will also be related to the company s operating achievements 
On the other hand  when the market is behaving in an irrational manner or during abnormal times  long term performance can be skewed by either overvaluation or undervaluation  I believe it s critically important that investors understand how valuation has impacted the performance on their individual stocks as well as their overall portfolios  This clarity of understanding will mitigate irrational fear in a bear market or investor complacency in a bull market like we have been experiencing recently 
FAST Graphs analyze out loud video  Valuing Roper Technologies Inc  in Multiple Ways
There are numerous ways to examine and then ascertain the fair value of a business public or private  I am often asked what I think is the best metric to use when trying to determine fair value  My answer to this question is simple and straightforward  I believe that investors should evaluate any stock they are examining over as many valuation metrics as they can  Therefore  my stock answer is to utilize every valuation resource at your disposal 
On the other hand  there are often certain metrics that apply best to specific companies  In the case of Roper Technologies Inc   I believe the best metric to evaluate valuation with is EBITDA  As I will illustrate in the video portion  Roper Technologies Inc  is unique in that the vast majority of its operating cash flow is free cash flow 

Summary and Conclusions
if you judge a stock investment solely on its historical price performance  it becomes very easy to overlook important reasons why the performance has occurred  If significant overvaluation is involved  you can fall into a complacency trap and ignore the risks that you are facing going forward  In contrast  if significant undervaluation is involved  you can easily see risk when in fact opportunity is being manifest  Consequently  the moral of the story is to make sure you measure fundamentals relative to recent price action  It is only through an evaluation of understanding of both the true insight can be had

11238,232753,DELL,3 Stocks To Watch This Coming Week  Dell   Best Buy  Deere   Company,opinion,"Though the trading week will be shortened ahead of this Thursday s Thanksgiving holiday  there are still plenty of things for investors to note  Wall Street continues to pin hopes on a breakthrough in U S  China trade negotiations after the U S  President  Donald Trump  said on Friday that a trade agreement with China was near 
Chinese President Xi Jinping  however  didn t provide a similar  strong signal  Instead he said  Beijing also wants to land a deal but would  fight back  if necessary  So  while the uncertainty on trade continues  keeping investors on the edge  there will still be some new information worth assimilating from a number of important companies  each scheduled to report quarterly earnings  In particular  we re watching these three stocks 
1  Dell Technologies
Dell Technologies  NYSE DELL  will release its fiscal Q3 2019 results on Tuesday  Nov  26 after the market close  Analysts expect  1 74 EPS on more than  23 8 billion in revenue 
During its forecast for fiscal 2020  the manufacturer of IT products and services provider  had warned that sales growth will slow over the next year  hurt by the global economic issues that may weaken corporate demand for the company s hardware products 

During the past year  Dell consistently generated strong hardware sales  as the company prepared to transition back to the public markets after five years of restructuring aimed at cutting back debt and simplifying a tangled corporate structure  Investors liked the restructured Dell  sending its shares higher by 50  until late May of 2019 
But the stock has fallen about 24  since then  after the company predicted there would be weaker spending on technology  Dell executives said during a call in August that they expected IT spending to be  soft  throughout the rest of the fiscal year  particularly in China 
The company also narrowed its annual revenue projection to  92 7 billion to  94 2 billion  from the February forecast of  93 billion to  96 billion 
2  Best Buy
 Best Buy   NYSE BBY  is another high profile name that will come under investor scrutiny this coming week  The big box electronics and technology chain reports Q3 earnings on Tuesday  Nov  26 before the market opens  The retailer is expected to produce  9 7 billion in revenue and  1 03 of profit per share  according to analysts  consensus 





Shares have rallied strongly this year  surging more than 35   as Best Buy continues to benefit from its expanding services business and the increasing assortment of inventory it stocks  such as smart home devices  door locks and cameras  along with appliances  video games and wearable devices  Shares closed at  72 64 on Friday 
That growth momentum may continue as Apple  NASDAQ AAPL   the company s largest supplier  is predicting strong demand for its new iPhone models  while U S  consumer spending during the key holiday period doesn t show any sign of slowing down 
The company s new CEO  Corie Barry  said in September that he sees revenue and profitability improving in the next five years as the retailer offers new services  expands its e commerce arm and moves into new areas such as health care 
3  Deere   Company  NYSE DE 
Deere   Company  NYSE DE   the world s largest tractor manufacturer  will release its Q3 earnings on Wednesday  Nov  27   before the market opens  Wall Street is expecting sales to come in at  8 5 billion and  2 14 of earnings per share 
In August  Deere pledged to lower its costs as it tried to overcome the negative impact of a trade war   The company also provided a cut in its forecast for Q4 2019 and fiscal 2020 that was lower than what investors had expected  citing the slowing global economy   





With production costs in some segments rising  the Moline  Illinois based company has initiated a series of actions to make the organization more structurally efficient and profitable  For fiscal 2019  equipment sales are now projected to rise about 4   with net income forecast at  3 2 billion  according to Deere s latest forecast  down from the 5  it had earlier projected

government s announcement of the U S  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed last December  Soon after that  fears of inflation and imposition of import tariffs of 25  on steel and 10  on aluminum stalled the positive momentum  Then  the recent joint attack by the United States  Britain and France on Syria rocked the world  leaving many pondering over its possible after effects Notwithstanding these issues  equity investors must closely follow the financial releases for the first quarter of 2018  Though results of some banking stocks failed to impress the market  we believe that important releases

many positive factors during the quarter must have supported growth for the industrial companies  Of many  trends indicating an expanding manufacturing sector  rising new orders for U S  made machinery  strengthening job market as evident from a 17 year low unemployment rate of 4 1  in March and 4 5  growth in industrial products in the first quarter are worth mentioning  What s in Store

11247,232762,ROP,5 Income Plays For 25 More Years Of Dividend Growth,opinion,"Have you always wanted to buy a safe stock like Coca Cola  NYSE KO  and get rich from it like Warren Buffett 
It s doable  But most investors  live in the past  and fixate on dividend track records rather than a payout s forward prospects  And looking ahead is the key to yearly gains of 10   15  or even 20  or more with dividend aristocrats 
Let s look at Coke  which achieved its dividend royalty status in 1987  its 25th straight year with a dividend hike   The firm hit its coronation with a head of steam  rewarding investors with a 362  payout hike in just five years  from 1986 to 1991   Its stock price raced to keep up with its dividend  rising 234  over the same time period 
Great Dividend Growth  Great Returns 
It didn t really matter if you bought shares before or after the company was officially a dividend aristocrat  The driving factor for profits was the dividend s velocity   it was moving higher quickly  so its stock price followed 
Fast forward to the last five years  and we see that Coke s youthful exuberance has slowed considerably  The firm still hikes its payout every year  but it s a slower climb   totaling 45  over the past five years  Which means its stock price merely plods along too   25  in five years  
Average Dividend Growth  Average Returns 
Why is Coke s dividend slowing down  Simple   just look at the top line 
Shrinking Business is Bad for Payouts
It sounds obvious  but income investors often wade so deep into the dividend weeds that they ignore obvious cues   such as shrinking sales 
Let s add Coke s top line into the last chart  and we ll see that the fact that the payout is growing at all is an act of financial wizardry 
Shrinking Sales Slow the Dividend 
Coke s top line has shrunk by 22  over the last five years  Which makes its dividend growth quite the feat 
Contrast this with the 1986 to 1991 period  when the company was younger and still growing  It boosted its sales by 30  over that time period 
Of course it s possible to grow payouts faster than profits and sales  In fact  this is what often happens with dividend payers  But even the most gifted managers can only squeeze so much in payouts from a shrinking pie  It s better to focus on businesses with the winds at their backs 
And That Can Include Spry Aristocrats  Too
In a minute  we ll discuss five Dividend Aristocrats that have years and even decades of profitable runway ahead 
Coke s future business prospects don t pass my taste test  Consumers are turning away from its core product of sugary beverages  The company knows this  and is expanding into other segments such as health and energy beverages   but it s forced to pay up for hot products 
 Which is why I m actually worried that Coke could be the next GE  It s following a similar problematic path   a pricey acquisition binge to patch its leaky sales bucket  
We re better off focusing on companies that are generating sales and profit growth organically  From there  we choose the firms that are financially fit enough to dish an increasing amount of their profits back to their shareholders every year 
That s how you buy the best dividend aristocrats  those that will keep their titles for years and even decades ahead  Here s a five pack with well positioned businesses for 2018  2028 and 2038 and beyond 
Medtronic  NYSE MDT  Dividend Yield  2 2 
Medtronic  MDT  is a medical device company that has its hands in numerous areas  About 35  of its revenues come from its cardiac and vascular group  a third from minimally invasive therapies  a quarter from restorative therapies and the remaining 6  from its diabetes group 
At the ground level  that means Medtronic makes devices such as insulin pumps  aortic stents  heart valves  electrosurgical instruments  tracheostomy tubes and surgical imaging systems 
The view from 10 000 feet is incredible  Healthcare costs have been rocketing unchecked seemingly forever  and the aging of the baby boomers is only helping to drive up demand for these life lengthening products  These trends aren t stopping anytime soon  with healthcare costs expected to climb 5 5  annually between 2017 and 2026  when they re expected to reach  5 7 trillion 
The company s most recent quarterly report exemplifies Medtronic s continued growth  including a 10  top line boost from its cardiac and vascular products  Net sales overall were a little slow  growing 1 2  to  7 4 billion  but they did beat estimates  More importantly  analysts expect the bottom line to grow in the high single digits for at least the next five years 
MDT also is generously expanding its dividend  which has grown by 64  since 2014  The company s projected profit growth  as well as a payout ratio of about 39  of this year s expected profits  means Medtronic should have plenty of ability to improve its dividend in the years and even decades ahead 
Becton  Dickinson and Company  NYSE BDX  Dividend Yield  1 3 
Becton  Dickinson  BDX  is another medical device company that  like Medtronic  spans numerous healthcare needs  Becton s product lineup covers areas ranging from anesthesia delivery  diabetes care and cervical cancer screening to infection protection  molecular diagnostics and specimen collection 
It s also one of the few companies that can actually claim to have swallowed up a fellow Dividend Aristocrat 
Near the end of 2017  Becton  Dickinson completed the acquisition of C R  Bard  itself a medical tech company that specialized in vascular  surgical and oncology products  among others  The deal is expected to  generate low single digit accretion to adjusted earnings per share in fiscal year 2018  and high single digit accretion in fiscal year 2019  
As a result  Wall Street is high on Becton  Dickinson s prospects for the years ahead  Analysts project average annual earnings growth of 14  for the next half decade  including a 16  bump in 2018 
Meanwhile  BDX should extend its 46 year dividend growth streak sometime later this year  Since 2014  the payout has plumped up by a healthy 38   and there s ample room to continue considering a meager 27  payout ratio based on 2018 s projected profits 
Becton  Dickinson  BDX   A Healthy Health Care Dividend Raiser 
Praxair  NYSE PX  Dividend Yield  2 1 
Praxair  PX  is proof of the concept that  boring is beautiful  
This is an industrial gases company that produces carbon dioxide  argon and oxygen  among other common gases  not to mention other specialty gases  mixtures and even handling equipment  In fact  Praxair even goes a step further by providing whole management and delivery systems  doing everything from cleaning to leak detection to inspection 
The beauty of Praxair is that industrial gases tend to be critical to operations but also a small portion of costs  Meanwhile  the company deals in contracts that are up to 20 years in length  meaning that it has some extremely established customers it can rely on to keep driving cash flow 
At the moment  Praxair is working on asset sales to facilitate its planned merger with German chemical giant Linde Group AG  The marriage should create  1 2 billion in annual cost and capex synergies and efficiencies 
PX is a newcomer to the Aristocrats  joining Roper Technologies  NYSE ROP  and A O  Smith  NYSE AOS  in 2018 after   Expect it to keep up its membership well into the future  with analysts expecting double digit annual profit growth for the next five years at a minimum 
3M  3M Company  NYSE MMM  Dividend Yield  1 9 
Yes  I m well aware that 3M  MMM  doesn t exactly look like its sterling self right now  After all  the name behind Post it Notes  Scotch Tape  Thinsulate and Nexcare healthcare products is coming off a rough first quarter earnings report in which it guided both its full year organic growth rate and profits lower 
But take heart 
3M shares are now off nearly 14  in 2018   one of the largest pullbacks in MMM in years  That gives investors the chance to jump into one of the most successful industrial companies on the planet for   well  at just less than times forward earnings  not exactly a bargain  but a more reasonable price than investors have been offered for some time 
3M  MMM  Hits a Bump in the Road   Not a Mountain 
3M  after all  offers more than 55 000 products that cover everything from adhesives to dental implements to fire protection to car care  3M generally benefits from a growing global economy  and its outstanding product diversification means that if one area slumps   
Despite the Q1 warning  analysts still are expecting 9  plus annual profit growth on average for the next five years  Meanwhile  MMM just celebrated its 60th consecutive dividend increase   a 16  improvement that keeps 3M among the ranks of the longest serving Dividend Aristocrats 
Ecolab  NYSE ECL  Dividend Yield  1 1 
Ecolab  ECL  is one of the   serving boring but vital functions while mostly keeping out of the public eye  But while most consumers haven t heard of Ecolab  they ve certainly benefited from its products 
ECL is responsible for keeping the power on  keeping the water flowing and keeping everything you come in contact with clean 
Ecolab s Nalco Water division provides water treatment technologies for large scale industries such as refining and petrochemicals  This helps companies save money by conserving water and energy  plus keeps them in line with ever changing environmental regulations  but also helping them save money by conserving water and energy  Ecolab also dabbles in everything from kitchen equipment repair to dishwashing solutions to pool and spa maintenance  for customers ranging from businesses to schools to government organizations 
Ecolab generates more than  1 billion in free cash flow every year  and the company is modeling as much as 16  earnings growth next year  while analysts are looking for a 15  pop  In fact  they re pretty bullish on the company s prospects even further into the future  with Wall Street s pros looking for 13  annual bottom line growth from now through 2023 
That  as well as a conservative 30  payout ratio  should keep the dividend hikes going well past Ecolab s 26 year increase streak 
How to Retire on 8  Dividends Paid EVERY MONTH
Dividend Aristocrats like 3M and Ecolab are impressive dividend growers  but a portfolio too reliant on Aristocrats will leave your retirement portfolio in haggard shape  In fact  with an average yield of less than 2   the Aristocrats deliver less income than the 10 year T note 

However  I have a  that not only will pay you 4 times more  but will pay you 3 times more often 
When you retire  chances are you ll be relying heavily on dividend income to get you through your regular expenses  the house  the car  power   you name it  But while most publicly traded companies tend to pay dividends out quarterly  your bills sure aren t quarterly  They come every single month  rain or shine 
That s why monthly dividend stocks make so much sense for long term retirement planners  A reliable stream of income that doesn t vary from month to month allows you to budget with precision  And with the right plan  you can collect  3 000 plus in dividends every single month   and do it with a smaller nest egg than even the suits at Merrill Lynch say you need to retire well 
My  checks off every box investors need from retirement 

Monthly income to use against your monthly bills 
Dividends large enough to allow you to live off investment income entirely  That means no selling your stocks and shrinking your nest egg  which ultimately shrinks your regular dividend paycheck 
Better returns on any dividends you choose to reinvest  If you don t need the income from your portfolio right away  you don t have to wait every three months to put dividends to work   you can sink them back into new investments just about every 30 days 

These monthly dividend payers include a few picks that have remained mostly under the radar despite their high payouts and general quality  For instance  this portfolio includes an 8 7  payer trading at a bizarre 5 3  discount to NAV  and a steady Eddy high yielder that barely blinks when stocks plummet 
Because these big dividends compound quicker  they ll turbocharge your net worth and allow you to enjoy the retirement you ve worked so dearly to reach  Don t delay

11250,232765,ROP,Roper Technologies  ROP  Set To Acquire PowerPlan For  1 1B,opinion,"Roper Technologies   NYSE ROP   recently announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire PowerPlan   a major provider of software and solutions from private equity firm  Thoma Bravo  This  1 1 billion all cash deal is expected to close in the second quarter 
PowerPlan is a provider of software solutions for asset centric businesses  This Atlanta  GA based company s well recognized software platform  which integrates detailed financial and operational data  helps in the optimization of customers  financial performance and reduces compliance risk 
Existing Business Scenario
Roper holds a dominant position in most markets where it operates  Additionally  the company has an optimum mix of highly engineered  niche oriented products that helps it to gain market share  Although Roper operates in a cyclical business environment  its diversified revenue stream has helped the company to counter the headwinds  We believe that Roper s innovative product pipeline will be a major catalyst over the long term 
Moreover  the company s unique asset light business model allows it to remain less dependent on large scale production equipment  This enables the company to remain profitable even when sales decline during recession  Notably  this Zacks Rank  2  Buy  company has gained 7 9  in the past six months  outperforming the  s increase of 0 5  

Roper s ardent eye for acquisitions is anticipated to strengthen its business and gain market share  In this regard  the ConstructConnect and the Deltek buyouts are worth mentioning as these acquisitions have reinforced the company s software and network businesses  We believe that the successful integration of the acquisitions should supplement Roper s top line performance  moving ahead 
Other Stocks to Consider
Some other top ranked stocks from the same space are Graco Inc    NYSE GGG    IDEX Corp    NYSE IEX   and Nordson Corp    NASDAQ NDSN    While Graco sports a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   IDEX and Nordson carry a Zacks Rank of 2  You can see

11251,232766,WYND,10 Out of Favor Stocks To Consider,opinion,"David Dreman  founder and Chairman of Dreman Value Management  is best known for his contrarian value investing strategy  His published research has proven that out of favor stocks significantly outperform stocks considered to have more favorable outlooks 
In a 2015   Dreman said this about low PE stocks 

 Low PE  multiples  have always outperformed the market enormously over 10  15 and 20 years  For example  we did a 35 year study where if an institutional investor had  1 million  he d have about  250 million at the end of those 35 years  This is against half of that for the S P and much less for higher PE stocks  

I used the finbox io stock screener to find stocks included in the Russell 1000 index that may be considered  out of favor   The specific screen criteria 
PE multiple   14 0x  represents the bottom 20  of Russell 1000 companies 
Free cash flow yield   8   represents the bottom 20  of Russell 1000 companies 
Trailing twelve month earnings growth   0 
Stock price is currently trading at less than 120  of its 52 week low  another helpful out of favor indicator 
Only 10 stocks fit the above criteria 10 Out of Favor StocksHere are the summary stats of the screen results Note that the five year return for this ten company index  142   significantly outperformed the S P 500  88 9   over the same period  However  notice below how this same ten company index significantly underperformed the S P 500 over the last year The chart below highlights the trailing twelve month PE multiples over the last 5 years for the ten company index vs the S P 500  all equally weighted  Source  CapitalIQ
Notice how the current 7 8x PE multiple for the ten company index is significantly below its five year average of approximately 20 0x Applying David Dreman s contrarian strategy  value investors may want to take a closer look at the following  out of favor  stocks 
AMC Networks  NASDAQ AMCX

11252,232767,WYND,Airbnb Could Be The Biggest IPO Of 2017,opinion,"Founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky  CEO   Joe Gebbia  CPO   and Nathan Blecharczyk  CTO   Airbnb is an app and website that connects people seeking lodging with renters who have listed their personal houses  apartments  guest rooms  etc   on either platform  Travelers can book accommodations around the world online or from a tablet or mobile phone 
Airbnb is an easy way for people to monetize any extra living space they have  With over 2 million listings worldwide including 1 400 castles it operates in over 34 000 cities and 191 countries  with a total guest list of more than 60 million people 
Airbnb as a Lifestyle
Back in 2014  Airbnb announced a huge  company wide rebranding  indicating a desire to transition from a hotel service to a lifestyle brand  Since its inception  it has been easy to categorize the company as just another hotel option  taking on big industry names like Wyndham   NYSE WYN    Hyatt   NYSE H    Hilton Worldwide   NYSE H   and InterContinental Hotels   NYSE IHG   
But its brand upheaval demonstrates how Airbnb has the potential to be something much more  In a   the company stated they want to possess a logo that will be seen on a variety of products  houses  and businesses  to make sure people understand that whoever owns it is a supporter of their ideal but  more importantly  a supporter of their brand 
Dubbed B lo  its logo is a symbol of belonging  While it may look like a misshapen paperclip  B lo is a  symbol for people who want to welcome into their home new experiences  new cultures  and new conversations   Airbnb has also redesigned its website and app  which are now far cleaner than previous versions  and feature subtle animations and flashier imagery 
The desire of a company to be more than its services is reminiscent of Shake Shack   NYSE H    the better for you New York City burger joint who went public in 2015  Shake Shack is finding great success by promoting themselves as a lifestyle brand  as well as putting themselves into the  fine casual  dining category 
So  what can Airbnb learn from this burger restaurant  Like Shake Shack did  would Airbnb benefit by staying private longer  Could extra time help the company reinforce reserves  address weaknesses  and plan for the future 
Controversies to Consider
Airbnb may present a legitimate challenge to the hotel industry  but the company is enveloped by controversy and regulatory issues in cities that are none too pleased with residents turning their homes into hotels 
In San Francisco  critics have blamed Airbnb for the growing vacancy rates and the over  3 900 average monthly rent  Average home prices in the city just hit the  1 1 million median mark  and San Francisco s population has reached an all time high  according to Paragon Real Estate Group  
Despite the absence of a permit  which  according to law  one must have in order to rent for under 30 days  San Francisco residents are still illegally listing personal homes and apartments for less than the required number of days on Airbnb  And recently  legislation was approved in San Francisco that would require anyone listing available property on Airbnb or other sites to register the property with the city  hindering a person s ability to casually list a spare room for some extra cash going forward
The company is also embroiled in a long standing battle with New York City  where they face similar issues as in San Francisco  Recently  the New York State Senate passed a bill that makes online apartment listings for stays shorter than 30 days illegal  which  not surprisingly  thwarts Airbnb in their goal to expand in the area  If Gov  Andrew Cuomo decides to sign the bill into law  some have calculated that it would delete roughly half of current Airbnb listings in New York 
The penalties for breaking the law will likely be harsh  with fines of  1 000 hitting providers of short term apartment rentals for the first offense and up to  7 500 by the third violation 
IPO Buzz
Since 2014  and regardless of its fight with certain cities  rumors have been swirling of Airbnb s inevitable initial public offering  even though CEO Chesky said no to an IPO at that time  In an interview with the Wall Street Journal  Chesky said that  we will do it at a time when it benefits the company  when we have a good reason  
Airbnb s last valuation clocked in at  25 5 billion  but the company reportedly just raised  850 million in August  putting its total equity funding at about  3 2 billion at a valuation of  and making it the second most valuable U S  startup behind Uber  This  as well as being a recognized name in the hotel industry and increasingly popular  sharing economy   is helping raise buzz  Their popularity among venture capitalists  VCs  is helping increase hype  too 
However  this new round of funding  in addition to a separate deal where investors are planning to buy  200 million in stock from Airbnb employees  could be seen as a move to relieve some of the pressure of filing for an IPO  Airbnb is adding significantly to its amount of available cash  allowing it to spend enough money to continue its global expansion without going public 
But like other tech startups  Airbnb is a company for the digital age  and VCs are clamoring to be the first ones to invest in its expected success  Billions of dollars have been invested in the digital sharing economy over the past few years specifically  in companies whose platforms are apps and websites that connect a person selling an item or service with a consumer who wants to use that item or service 
According to Neil Sequeira  managing director of VC firm General Catalyst Partners in Palo Alto  California  these types of companies are well liked among investors  Particularly  Airbnb is popular because it is inexpensive to run  it doesn t have to build or maintain hotels or hotel staff  The company is also easy to grow quickly  as there is no need for a physical office in every country  just consumers with a smartphone 
 The reason they make better investments is they are very high margin at scale you re basically closing a transaction  You don t get that dirty   said Sequeira 
How Might Airbnb Perform 
Like any tech startup  Airbnb s IPO will be a toss up  Its tentative valuation of  30 billion is impressive in and of itself  and will most likely be the driving factor for investors come time for a public entrance into the market 
Airbnb needs to keep an eye on their increasing competition  Companies like     and the Expedia   NASDAQ EXPE   owned  all have a dedicated following of their own  and are all beginning to eat into the market share 
Despite rival companies and regulatory issues  Airbnb has the potential to be one of the hottest upcoming IPOs  With billions of dollars in investments already  a thriving rebranding  and its rising popularity among travelers  Airbnb s IPO is one to watch out for

	Today  Zacks is promoting its   Buy   stock recommendations    

Here are highlights from Friday s Analyst Blog  

Marriott Poised to Grow on Starwood Takeover Despite Risks

	On Sep 29  we issued an updated research report on Marriott  NASDAQ        Marriott recently completed its previously announced acquisition of Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc   which led to the creation of the world s largest hotel company  After getting the much awaited approval from the Chinese regulatory agency  MOFCOM   both the companies closed the transaction shortly 

	The combined entity would now operate or franchise more than 5 700 hotels which comprise around 1 1 million rooms globally  bringing together 30 brands catering to all lodging segments 
	Meanwhile  with economic boost and an improvement in business and leisure travel  Marriott is well poised to grow in the near as well as long term 
	Apart from focusing on the lucrative domestic market  Marriott is consistently striving to expand its international footprint  especially in Asia  Middle East  Europe and Latin America  The acquisition of Starwood also bode well in this regard as it would greatly expand Marriott s reach in Europe and Latin America markets 
	Other hoteliers like Wyndham Worldwide Corporation  NYSE     Hyatt Hotels Corporation  NYSE     andHilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   NYSE      are also capitalizing on growing prospects in the international markets 
	Further  Marriott is significantly investing in technology for hotel bookings  in order to improve guest experience  which in turn should boost occupancy  Moreover  frequent share buybacks and continuous increase in quarterly dividend payments further affirm the company s optimistic outlook and growth prospects 
	However  macroeconomic concerns in several emerging economies might spell trouble for Marriott  Particularly  the slowdown in the Chinese economy is hurting discretionary spending and  in turn  travel  Also  in Europe  economic political conditions are expected to be challenging after the U K  s exit from the 28 member economic bloc 
	Meanwhile  in the domestic market  the company is facing competition in New York due to a continuous increase in supply of hotels  which is limiting room rents  thereby hurting RevPAR in the region  Further  in Houston  RevPAR is expected to be sluggish due to weakness in the energy sector 
	Also  Marriott is highly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates  given its significant international presence

11258,232773,ROP,4 Future Dividend Aristocrats With 87  Upside,opinion,"What s the best way to add the consistent income growth of the Dividend Aristocrats to your portfolio without paying the  royalty premium  of these popular  well covered stocks 
Buy  em while they re young 
Right now  there are a handful of stocks I want to show you today that are knocking on the door of Dividend Aristocrats membership  We re talking only one to three years shy of the 25 year benchmark of consecutive annual dividend increases 
That means they still boast more than two decades  worth of higher payouts  which is plenty of proof that they ve got bulletproof financials and put shareholders  interests on a pedestal 
These stocks usually boast more upside than their more experienced counterparts  too  Let s consider the performance of the three newest Aristocrats   Praxair  NYSE PX   Smith AO Corporation  NYSE AOS  and Roper Technologies Inc  NYSE ROP  over the past few years  They ve delivered total returns  including dividends  between 36  and 87  
Fresh Faced Dividend Aristocrats Deliver Returns Up to 87 
Today  there are a handful of Aristocrat hopefuls that are close to the royal court  Two of them have potential similar to what we ve seen out of A O  Smith and Roper Technologies   which means they could quickly double from here 
But not all inductees are buys   I ve also identified two almost Aristocrats that we should avoid 
Essex Property Trust  NYSE ESS Dividend Yield  3 1 Dividend Hike Streak  24 years
Essex Property Trust  ESS  is about to become a rarity  The apartment real estate investment trust  REIT  is just a year away from becoming only the second REIT in the Dividend Aristocrats   Federal Realty Investment Trust  FRT  is currently the only real estate play in the 53 member group   Such an announcement likely will come in February 2019  
Essex  which manages multifamily apartment communities in the West Coast   including Southern California  Northern California and Seattle   went public in 1994  but has been in the real estate game since 1971  Essex s geographic concentration means the REIT has been  and will continue to be  a beneficiary of the boom in technology  in fact  the headquarters of the 10 biggest publicly traded tech companies by market capitalization are all located within Essex s markets 
This REIT may be putting together an impressive dividend growth streak  but that s not because actual business growth is anywhere near  mature   The company s funds from operations  FFO  have exploded by nearly 380  over the past decade  And Essex kept its growth story going in Q1 of this year  recording 5  FFO growth  raising its full year FFO growth forecast   and  of course  expanding its dividend by 6 3  
Essex Property Trust  ESS  Is Riding Tech s Coattails to Riches
It s not often that a REIT deserves to be called  exciting   but Essex is worthy 
Realty Income Corp  NYSE O Dividend Yield  5 Dividend Hike Streak  24 years
Realty Income  O  has staked its reputation to its dividend  which admittedly has a pretty impressive track record  The self proclaimed  monthly dividend company  has paid 574 consecutive monthly dividends  increased its payout for 82 consecutive quarters  and boasts 4 7  compound annualized dividend growth since its 1994 IPO  Moreover  like Essex  the company is just one year away from Dividend Aristocracy 
No one is questioning Realty Income s legitimacy on the dividend front  It s for real 
However  even Realty Income s impressive dividend growth and elevated income level   at 5   O shares are yielding near the high end of their five year range   isn t enough reward for  
Realty Income  O   A Good Yield  But at What Price 
  and even though it has lost a quarter of its value since then  I still don t like the value prospects here given the harsh realities Realty Income faces 
That s because Realty Income is a retail REIT  and thus is in Amazon s crosshairs  Sure  some of its tenants include the likes of LA Fitness  no threat from Amazon  NASDAQ AMZN   and FedEx  NYSE FDX   FDX  which actually benefits from Amazon at the moment   it also leases out single tenant properties to the likes of Walgreens  WBA  and Kroger  NYSE KR  that absolutely are in the path of the e commerce wrecking ball 
Realty Income might not lose you money in the next few years  but it ll face an uphill climb to cover any significant ground 
Five percent remains respectable today  It puts the stock s payout on a perch just above the safest fixed income investments  like Treasuries  
But is 5   enough compensation given that O s property holding are shakier than ever  I m not sure  As a retail landlord  it s a crapshoot every month as to which rents are going to get paid   and 
Instead of gambling on O  I d prefer to bet on surer things   like bonds that will actually rise in value as rates continue to climb 
Ross Stores  NASDAQ ROST Dividend Yield  0 9 Dividend Hike Streak  24 years
Close your eyes and think about a stock that is trading near all time highs  has ripped off 152  gains in five years and has generated double digit annual profit growth for the past half decade 
Open your eyes  What did you imagine  A hot chip stock  Maybe a defense contractor or a biopharma play 
Nope  Those stats belong to discount retailer Ross Stores  ROST  
Wait  Seriously 
It seems almost unimaginable to be bullish about brick and mortar retailers given that looming Amazon threat  But there are a couple of exceptions  and Ross Stores   which has 1 409 stores across 37 states  the District of Columbia and Guam   is one of them 
Ross delivers brand names at deep discount prices  even undercutting rival TJX Companies Inc  NYSE TJX  TJ Maxx brand by about 33   That s enough to keep people coming through its doors even as customers flee other brick and mortar outfits  The company actually recorded 4  same store sales growth last year   a figure that would make most other fashion retailers chartreuse with envy 
Better still  Wall Street s pros are modeling 10  annual profit growth for the next five years  Moreover  the company has put up 165  dividend growth over the past five years but still has a payout ratio of less than 20  
Sears Holdings Corporation  NASDAQ SHLD   JC Penney Company Inc Holding  NYSE JCP  and Macy s Inc  NYSE M  are toast  But Ross Stores looks like the truth 
International Business Machines  NYSE IBM Dividend Yield  4 2 Dividend Hike Streak  23 years
International Business Machines  IBM  has done at least one thing right this year  It got the sales monkey off its back  In January of this year  the company reported a modest 4  year over year improvement in revenues   good enough to snap a 22 quarter streak of sales declines 
But Big Blue remains a big disappointment 
Dividend Growth Doesn t Matter If Everything Else Is Plunging
IBM shares have essentially been dead money for a decade as the enterprise tech fell behind in the race to the cloud and spent years trying to catch up  Admittedly  IBM at least has its head in the right place  focusing on the cloud  cybersecurity and data analytics  but its lousy push off the starting blocks really set the company back 
The most recent quarter wasn t exactly encouraging  While IBM did beat on the top and bottom lines  profit margins were helped by a one time tax gain and  backing that out  weren t exactly up to snuff  Moreover  revenues from its so called  strategic imperatives   those growthier cloud and data initiatives  among others  merely met expectations  discouraging analysts 
Also disappointing was IBM s dividend increase  which came in at less than 5    one of its cheapest hikes in years  A plateauing dividend is often a problematic sign 
How to Retire on 8  Dividends Paid EVERY MONTH
Relying on dividend growth from the likes of IBM will leave your retirement portfolio in tatters  In fact  even relying on Dividend Aristocrats in general could be dangerous   with an average yield of less than 2   the Aristocrats deliver less income than the 10 year T note 

However  I have a  that not only will pay you 4 times more  but will pay you 3 times more often 
When you retire  chances are you ll be relying heavily on dividend income to get you through your regular expenses  the house  the car  power   you name it  But while most publicly traded companies tend to pay dividends out quarterly  your bills sure aren t quarterly  They come every single month  rain or shine 
That s why monthly dividend stocks make so much sense for long term retirement planners  A reliable stream of income that doesn t vary from month to month allows you to budget with precision  And with the right plan  you can collect  3 000 plus in dividends every single month   and do it with a smaller nest egg than even the suits at Merrill Lynch say you need to retire well 
My  checks off every box investors need from retirement 

Monthly income to use against your monthly bills 
Dividends large enough to allow you to live off investment income entirely  That means no selling your stocks and shrinking your nest egg  which ultimately shrinks your regular dividend paycheck 
Better returns on any dividends you choose to reinvest  If you don t need the income from your portfolio right away  you don t have to wait every three months to put dividends to work   you can sink them back into new investments just about every 30 days 

These monthly dividend payers include a few picks that have remained mostly under the radar despite their high payouts and general quality  For instance  this portfolio includes an 8 7  payer trading at a bizarre 5 3  discount to NAV  and an 8 5  payer that not 1 in 1 000 people even know about 
Because these big dividends compound quicker  they ll turbocharge your net worth and allow you to enjoy the retirement you ve worked so dearly to reach  Don t delay

11259,232774,WYND,The Real Truth About Millennial Investors,opinion,"We ve finally reached late August  meaning your Facebook newsfeed is probably brimming with children and teenagers sporting brand new sneakers and backpacks in preparation for their first day of school 
Maybe one or two of your young ones are heading back this week or next  If so  I wish them all the best this year  and I hope you enjoy and cherish watching them grow 
It s also around this time that hundreds of thousands of 18 year olds will be attending their very first day of college or university  This cohort  born mostly in 1998  is among the youngest of millennials  the generation born between 1980 and 2000 
According to Census Bureau data  millennials are now the most populous adult segment in U S  history  83 1 million strong as of last summer   By comparison  baby boomers number 75 4 million  
This is why I find it so crucial to keep up with the trends  lifestyles and spending habits of this important group  not least of all because my own two sons belong to it   Any investment manager would be wise to do the same  Millennials are often characterized as entitled  lazy and disengaged  but many of these perceptions fail to stand up to scrutiny when we consider what they ve already achieved in the information technology space 
If you regularly use Facebook Inc  NASDAQ FB   Airbnb  Uber  Pinterest  Dropbox or any number of other popular apps valued in the tens of billions  you benefit from the work and imagination of entrepreneurs who came of age sometime during George W  Bush s eight year presidency 
There s no getting around it  Millennials are our future leaders  innovators  consumers and investors  By 2020 a mere four years from now they will make up an estimated 50 percent of the global workforce  What s more  they re expected to control between  19 trillion and  24 trillion on a global scale  according to consulting firm Deloitte 
Twenty four trillion dollars  Let that sink in for a moment 
The First Digital Natives One of the best ways to get a clear sense of the world this group has come of age in  I ve found  is the  Every August since 1998  Beloit College has put together a list of cultural touchstones that helped shape and influence the current incoming class of college freshmen 
Last year  I was fascinated to learn that the class of 2019 has  to answer their questions  always treated Wi Fi as an entitlement  always known marijuana as a legal therapeutic substance in a growing number of states 
This year s list for the class of 2020 is no less eye opening  Below  I ve selected several points that illustrate millennials  close relationship with digital technology 
There has always been a digital swap meet called eBay 
They have never had to watch or listen to programs at a scheduled time 
If you want to reach them  you d better send a text emails are oft ignored 
Books have always been read to you on audible com 
Bluetooth has always been keeping us wireless and synchronized 
Airline tickets have always been purchased online 
Taken together  these observations shed some light on the expectations millennials have of their brands and services expectations such as convenience  immediacy  transparency and a strong sense of community 
It doesn t matter how iconic or longstanding a brand is  If it fails to deliver on these expectations  83 million millennials will antiquate it   Remember Blockbuster   Word of mouth is as important as ever  but the scope has vastly been broadened since their parents and grandparents  time  from a handful of neighbors and acquaintances to a digital sea of millions 
Social Responsibility Matters More so than past generations  millennials are mindful of ethical business practices and base many of their spending and investment decisions on those practices 
A recent study conducted by marketing tech firm Adroit Digital found that 38 percent of millennial consumers will drop a brand for another if it s alleged to be doing  bad business  consciously polluting a river  for example  or mistreating workers 
That social awareness translates to the investment side  even among wealthy investors  A vast majority of younger high net worth individuals  HNWIs   defined as those controlling wealth greater than  10 million  expect their money managers to  screen investments based on environmental  social and governance factors   according to FactSet 
Sixty one percent of millennials see these factors as essential  more than double the rate of their 55 and older peers 

Proceeding with Caution The 2008 2009 financial crisis had a huge  lasting impact on young investors  who might have seen the value of their parents  401 k s and portfolios cut nearly in half  As a result  many twenty and thirty somethings tend to be a bit more cautious and conservative with their finances than Mom and Dad 
Consider this  In December 2015  UBS surveyed 2 638 affluent investors  including 584 millennials  on their investment attitudes  As a group  millennials maintained a larger cash holding than older generations  41 percent on average  compared to Generation X s 28 percent and baby boomers  20 percent  and were unsatisfied with how their portfolios were positioned  Only 15 percent claimed they were  very happy   compared to 32 percent of Generation X and 50 percent of baby boomers 
This could partially explain why millennials also have a much greater propensity to rent instead of commit to buying which  in turn  helps explain the meteoric rise of  sharing economy  pioneers such as Uber  now worth more than Ford and GM  and Airbnb  worth more than Hyatt and Wyndham Worldwide  
Meanwhile  younger and lower income Americans are less likely than their older peers to participate in investments such as mutual funds  This is worrisome  especially since they themselves are skeptical of Social Security s longevity  According to the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies  TCRS   as many as 80 percent of millennials fear Social Security will no longer be around by the time they retire 
Fortunately  we have a solution 
Dollar Cost Averaging For many cautious millennials  taking a more long term  disciplined approach to investing makes sense  This can be achieved through dollar cost averaging  an investment technique that lets you invest a fixed amount in a specific investment at regular  automatic intervals often just  100 per month 
Think of it like dipping your foot into a lake inch by inch  instead of taking a running leap off a 20 foot cliff

11261,232776,WYND,France Bleeds Again  ETFs   Stocks In Focus,opinion,"Within less than a year  France met with its second terror attack on Thursday  Over 80 people were killed and around 18 injured when a heavy truck smashed a mass watching Bastille Day fireworks in the French Riviera city of Nice 
Eight months back  Paris had encountered the worst terror attack in Europe in over a decade  A chain of Islamic State backed terrorist attacks had killed around 130 people and left hundreds injured  read    
How Will the Investing World React 
The recent upsurge in terrorism is not only a threat to mankind  but also to the global investing space  Global stocks are expected to dive as risk on sentiments will be hurt by this attack  though stocks are showing resilience as of now 
Needless to say  the epicenter of the crisis   France   will be the worst hit with French stocks likely to be under pressure in the coming few days  iShares MSCI France ETF  will likely bear the brunt of this likely sell off 
However  among all asset classes and sectors  there are a few sectors that are likely to be hit hard while some may gain  Below we highlight those sectors that are in focus after the Nice attack 
Likely Losers
Hospitality 
Since tourism and hospitality sectors are hit hard after a terror attack in any place  France will also likely see the same fate  Not only France  big European cities that are the soft targets of terrorist groups might see a fallback in their tourism and hotel industry  Notably  the tourist industry accounts for about  of the French economy Thanks to this fear for tourism  big U S  based hotel chains that have considerable exposure in Europe  may see retreating share price  Marriott International Inc     NASDAQ MAR     Hyatt Hotels Corporation   NYSE H   and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation   NYSE WYN   are some such companies  Not only hotels  since travelers are likely to abandon cruise trips  Carnival  LON CCL  Corporation    NYSE CCL    and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd     NYSE RCL    might be in a tight spot in the coming days Notably  consumer discretionary ETF PowerShares DWA Consumer Cyclicals Momentum Portfolio   AX PEZ   invests over 16  in Hotels  Restaurants   Leisure  and may thus feel the pressure 
Airlines Needless to say  lower tourism and business travel means lesser air travel  Though the impact of the attack is likely to be short lived  travelers might take some more time to get back to their previous euphoria  shrugging off all fears  The pure play Airline ETF U S  GLOBAL JETS ETF   NS JET   could thus see losses in the coming days  Another product PowerShares Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment Portfolio  also invests considerably in the airlines sector  read    
Potential Gainers 
Social Media 
People around the world will likely take the social media route to condemn the attack and express their solidarity with the sufferers  This in turn should boost social media stocks like Facebook   NASDAQ FB   and Twitter   NYSE TWTR    giving the pure play social media ETF Global X Social Media Index ETF   CM SOCL   reasons to surge ahead  read    
Defense 
Such back to back attacks in different parts of the globe once again fortifies the need for a strong defense base  After all  such geo political risks are favorable for weapon manufacturers and defense contractors 
In any case  the sector is in good shape and may inch up in the coming days pushing iShares US Aerospace and Defense ETF   HN ITA    SPDR S P Aerospace   Defense ETF    LON XAR    andPowerShares Aerospace   Defense Portfolio     read    
Cyber Security 
Along with defense  the need for more cyber security has become more obvious  In fact  many have contemplated whether governments should have an access to technology that reserves the confidentiality of people s correspondence  for the sake   at the time of the Paris attack 
All these talks and urgencies may put cyber security stocks and the related ETFs  namely PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF   NYSE H   and First Trust NASDAQ CEA Cybersecurity ETF  in focus in the coming days

11262,232777,WYND,U S  Hotel Industry Stock Outlook   July 2016,opinion,"The U S  hotel industry slowed down in the first half of 2016 compared to 2015 levels  Apart from a decline in occupancy levels in the first half  negative currency translation and pockets of geopolitical instability and economic slowdown raised concerns 
However  business and leisure travel increased on the back of an improving economy and positive employment numbers  Moreover  hoteliers have realized that franchising their brand and services is better than owning real estate to counter economic volatility 
The Positives
Notwithstanding the macroeconomic hurdles  the lodging sector is expected to grow in the second half of 2016  thanks to strong investor appetite  increasing travel demand and higher transaction volumes 
As per the summer forecast fromSmith Travel Research  STR   a leading information and data provider for the lodging industry the U S  hotel industry is expected to experience record high room demand during the Jun to Aug 2016 phase  STR stated that the number of rooms sold during the summer months is estimated to inch up roughly 2 1  on a year over year basis  banking on the current trend in the U S 
However  a healthy supply pipeline is anticipated to lead to a 1 7  increase in the number of rooms available and is likely to keep occupancy growth subdued at 0 4   Moreover  hoteliers are not likely to raise prices to match 2015 levels 
Nonetheless  as per STR  the average daily rate  ADR  at U S  hotels is expected to go up 4  in 2016  Further  mega sporting events like the Olympics in Brazil in August should boost tourism in the second half 
Thus  as hoteliers strive to enhance value and competitiveness  industry best practices such as sustainability  brand refreshment and increased visibility through technological innovation and social networking   especially among millennials   will remain their priorities 
What s Hurting the Hoteliers 
Hoteliers have been focusing on renovation and digital and marketing initiatives to boost traffic and capitalize on the growing tourism numbers  However  to do that  steep costs incurred by leading hoteliers are taking a toll on profits  Further  online travel agents like Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE    EXPE   TripAdvisor  TRIP  and The Priceline Group Inc   PCLN  are limiting the pricing power of these brands 
Statistics further underscore the slowing down in the hotel industry  A recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers   PwC   shows that occupancy levels at U S  hotels have begun to stabilize after reaching peak levels in 2015  PwC also lowered the 2016 and 2017 revenue per available room  RevPAR  growth outlook for hotels to 4 6  and 3 7   respectively  Notably  RevPARgrowth in 2015 was 6 2  
The slowdown in China  lingering uncertainty in various international markets  and increased supply growth are expected to pose headwinds  Moreover  in Europe  economic political conditions are expected to be challenging post Brexit 
Another major threat comes from home sharing companies like Airbnb  which offer a digital service allowing travelers to book homes at holiday destinations  With lower overhead costs and far less regulations than what hotel companies have to comply with  these firms have made steady inroads into the industry and are grabbing shares from giants like Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc   HOT   Marriott International  Inc   MAR  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   HLT  
Nonetheless  Marriott s deal to acquire Starwood Hotels is being viewed as a move to combat the rising threat from online travel agents and home sharing companies  Other hoteliers like Hyatt Hotels Corporation  H  and Wyndham Worldwide  NYSE WYN  Corporation  WYN  are also investing in home sharing start ups to combat Airbnb

Conclusion

11263,232778,WYND,Vacations On Your Mind  Invest In Hotel Stocks ,opinion,"The hotel industry has been on the path of recovery for some time now  supported by stronger economic metrics and the increasingly positive employment scenario  Notably  despite economic and political upheaval in certain pockets around the world  demand remains strong and sales have been robust in the U S  However  declining occupancy levels are a concern 
Nonetheless  on the brighter side  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader hotel industry over both the short and the long term  Below  we discuss what investors can look forward to in the coming years 
Demand Exceeds Supply  The recovery in the broader economy has been a boon for the hotel industry as it has perked up leisure and transient business travel demand  According to Hyatt Hotels Corporation  H  and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc   HLT   the supply demand environment in the U S  is favorable as demand growth is better than supply  which is below the long term average  This would lead to an increase in rates  thereby driving revenue per available room  RevPAR  
We note that demand growth in the U S  has outpaced supply growth each year since 2010  Meanwhile  though the gap between demand growth and supply growth continues to narrow and occupancy growth has slowed  higher rates are expected to keep driving RevPAR  Moreover  in spite of the large pipeline of hotels  Smith Travel Research  STR  expects the sector s demand growth in 2016 to be 2 1  in the U S  with only 1 7  increase in supply 
International Expansion  Major hoteliers are exploring growth opportunities abroad  especially in the emerging markets and the outlying areas surrounding major cities  Despite the macroeconomic concerns in several of the emerging economies  hoteliers are forging ahead with expansion plans in markets with great long term potential 
A number of U S  based hoteliers are targeting the unsaturated markets in Asia Pacific  the Middle East  Brazil  Russia and Africa  Within Asia  China promises lucrative growth opportunities  despite the economic slowdown  with visits expected to increase substantially in the second half of 2016  In fact  the country is a major revenue contributor for both Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc   HOT  and Marriott International  Inc   MAR  
Apart from China  India is becoming a hot spot for U S  based hoteliers with its emergence as a global business hub  Although economic growth rates are slightly lower than China  the country has great long term growth potential as a tourism market  Among others  Japan  Australia  Singapore and Thailand continue to attract travelers  Major players in the industry are also targeting the high potential Middle East countries such as Turkey and United Arab Emirates  UAE  that offer strong infrastructure 
Meanwhile  growth in Brazil and Argentina continues to be sluggish  mainly due to economic slowdown in Latin America  However  Brazil is scheduled to host a mega sporting event    the 2016 Summer Olympics in August    which should boost tourism to a certain extent 
Meanwhile  Europe still remains an attractive market for hoteliers despite the repeated terror attacks and Brexit induced uncertainties  Major players like Marriott  Hilton  and Wyndham Worldwide  NYSE WYN  Corporation  WYN  have a strong foothold in this region 
Brand Renovation to Boost Growth  Hotel chains are meticulously working on guest satisfaction via brand conversion and re modeling to gain a competitive advantage  Remodeling mostly involves restoration of lobbies and other public spaces  preservation of decorative features if possible  and guestroom upgrades to make the brand more relevant  In fact  brand perception is likely to have a growing influence on the mass market as well as the luxury space  With the market becoming increasingly saturated  especially the luxury segment  hotels will have to differentiate themselves 
Brands that can offer something uniquely compelling are likely to grab market share and thus the ability to innovate will be the key to success  Therefore  many leading hoteliers like Starwood  Marriott  Belmond Ltd   BEL  and Hyatt are firing on all cylinders to make their brands more relevant in today s environment 
Moreover  in recent times  brand development is being shaped not only by economic trends  but also by millennials  tastes  It is Gen Y that constitutes a major portion of the current tourism numbers who have a different horizon of expectation than their preceding generations  According to players in the hospitality sector  eco awareness  wellness and brand distinctiveness are important themes for this generation 
Big hotel brands are thus launching more lifestyle hotels  which are mainly boutique brands that benefit from parent companies  infrastructure  These include brands like Starwood s Element and Aloft  Marriott s Edition  Andaz by Hyatt and InterContinental Hotels Group s  IHG  Hotel Indigo 
Building Loyalty through Social Media and the Smartphone Technology  In today s age of price comparisons and the increasing norm of a sharing economy  hotels have to constantly push their boundaries to retain customers  In this regard  digital innovation and social media are starting to play an increasingly important role in the hotel industry  Social media can enhance a brand s prospects by connecting directly with guests  especially the millennials and can  in turn  increase loyalty and market share  Social media sites like Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Inc   FB   Twitter  Inc   TWTR  and TripAdvisor Inc  NASDAQ TRIP    TRIP  are commonly used by travelers select hotels 
Moreover  hoteliers are using apps to help guests manage bookings and are offering interactive maps GPS as well as reward programs to increase occupancy  Being tech savvy is thus no longer an option but a necessity to survive in the intensely competitive hotel industry 
In fact  according to Navis  a leading innovative hospitality technology solution provider    which quoted eMarketer s latest estimates of digital and travel research and booking    51 8  of travelers who book trips digitally in 2016 will do so through a mobile device  This is a sharp uptick from 43 8  in 2015  and highlights the importance of smartphones in online travel 
Hoteliers are therefore looking to introduce responsive designs in their apps  one click booking  and location technology to improve operating efficiencies and enhance guest services 
Many hotel companies are setting up analytics tools to understand consumer preferences    and deliver a differentiated experience    which could eventually motivate customers to visit frequently  stay longer and spend more  Loyalty programs are the key to better brand experience and hoteliers are continuously reengineering these to provide a more fulfilling experience 
Among the bullish hotel stocks we currently have Intrawest Resorts Holdings  Inc   SNOW   sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and Belmond  BEL   holding a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Despite being Zacks Ranked  3  Hold  stocks  we are also optimistic about Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corp   VAC   Red Lion Hotels Corp   RLH   China Lodging Group  Ltd   HTHT  and La Quinta Holdings Inc   LQ   given the momentum in their underlying businesses 
Bottom Line
An anticipated and typically strong summer for U S  hotels is expected to drive profitability and boost investor confidence  In that case  the lodging sector will prove to be a worthy investment proposition for the second half of 2016 provided the economy shows signs of recovery  which it already is  However  concerns related to a moderately sluggish economy and political trouble elsewhere will remain as headwinds 
But there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the hotel industry over the long haul in an increasingly globalized world  Does this mean investing in the space right now is the right option

11264,232779,WYND,Hotels Stocks Pay The Price Of Economic Woes  Terror Attacks,opinion,"Granted  sales in the hotel industry have been pretty solid in the U S   and emerging markets have great growth prospects  But it would still be prudent for investors to take a closer look at some of the dampeners before investing in the hotel industry  Particularly  macroeconomic concerns in several emerging economies could spell trouble for the hoteliers 
Below  we discuss some of the headwinds that the hotel stocks may face in the near as well as the long term 
Lingering Uncertainty in Certain International Markets  Despite immense growth potential  hoteliers are still apprehensive of several macroeconomic issues in the international markets  like the social political impact of the unexpected   Brexit   vote and decelerating growth in certain parts of Asia 
Moreover  high inflation rates and currency devaluation in Latin America  especially Brazil and Argentina  have arrested overall sales  Brazil  Argentina and Ecuador witnessed a decline in hotel occupancy in the first half of 2016  The weak Latin American economy  aggravated by political turmoil  led to softer tourism numbers in 2015  which continued through the first half of 2016 
In Europe  economic political conditions are expected to be challenging after U K  s exit from the 28 member economic bloc  Business in Europe is as it is clouded by the economic uncertainties in the Northern region and deflation in the Eurozone 
Recent terror attacks on key European cities like London  Paris and Brussels have also affected tourism numbers  The attacks in Brussels dealt a severe blow to Europe s tourism industry  just as it was going into peak season with hopes of a turnaround from the canceled bookings that followed the Paris attacks last year  Further  concerns of more terror attacks and violence against foreign tourists are increasingly hurting the trade in many African countries such as Kenya and Nigeria 
If that wasn t enough  the slowing down of the Chinese economy and concerns about Japan  owing to a weaker yen and tax increases  are adding to the hoteliers  woes  Notably  the economic growth rate of China moderated in recent times with its 2015 GDP growth touching a 25 year low  The slowdown in the Chinese economy is thus hurting discretionary spending and  in turn  travel 
Meanwhile  the Middle East and Africa has seen a decline in international arrivals due to a drop in oil prices and increase in security concerns  political unrest and rising supply 
In fact  a majority of leading hoteliers expect soft demand in the oil producing regions  which mainly include parts of Texas  Houston  Louisiana  Houston  Oklahoma City and West Virginia to continue hurting RevPAR  However  with oil prices on the rise again  demand trends could improve in these regions 
Meanhwile  taking into account the impact of a weaker global macro outlook  Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT  Inc   HOT  reduced its guidance range for worldwide  system wide constant dollar RevPAR to 2  to 4  
Fluctuation in Exchange Rates  Most of the major hoteliers generate a substantial portion of their revenues from customers outside the U S  Hence  any unfavorable change in currency may hurt their financials to a great extent  Though the dollar weakened slightly in 2016 compared to the previous year  the negative currency impact is still significant 
As Starwood has a significant international presence  management has guided foreign exchange headwinds to negatively impact full year earnings by around  17 million in 2016  Meanwhile  Marriott International  Inc   MAR  and Wyndham Worldwide Corp  NYSE WYN    WYN  are bearing the brunt of the Venezuelan currency devaluation 
Such volatility in exchange rates would continue to hurt the results of the hoteliers as it has been doing so over the past few quarters 
Operating Margins Under Pressure  Though revenue per available room  RevPAR  has fairly picked up since the industry started recovering in 2009  operating margins are yet to reach the industry peak of 2007 in the U S  due to a spike in costs  Hoteliers are looking to differentiate themselves and keep up with changing consumer tastes through investments in technology  quick customer service and real time marketing  These are denting margins even further  Additionally  most hoteliers plan to gain a competitive advantage and differentiate their brands through renovation  This comes at the cost of near term margins 
Additionally  online booking sites like Expedia Inc  NASDAQ EXPE    EXPE  and The Priceline Group s  PCLN  Booking com are limiting the pricing power of these hotels  which are contracting their margins  Further  the higher commission rates charged for the hotels are hurting margins  Meanwhile  with lower overhead costs and less stricter regulations than hotel companies  home sharing companies like Airbnb  Inc  are also grabbing share away from traditional players 
Healthcare Reforms to Hurt Profitability  The Affordable Care Act  commonly known as Obamacare  is expected to have an adverse impact on hoteliers  margins  The law entails hotels with 100 or more full time equivalent employees to offer healthcare coverage to nearly all full time employees and their dependents beginning this year 
Also  from 2016  employers with 50 to 99 full time equivalent employees have also been included under this Act  Notably  employers will be suffering penalties for any non compliance  This would continue to raise costs for hoteliers in the near term 
Some of the players in the space induce our cautious to bearish outlook  Currently  Starwood  Marriott   Hyatt Hotels Corporation  H   Extended Stay America  Inc   STAY  and Choice Hotels International Inc   CHH  have a Zacks Rank  4  Sell   while Intercontinental Hotels Group  LON IHG  plc  IHG  carries a Zacks Rank  5  Strong Sell  
Bottom Line
As you can see  there are plenty of reasons to be cautious about the hotel industry over the long term  But what about investing in the space right now  Are there opportunities for short term investors

11268,232783,ROP,Here s Why You Should Hold On To Colfax  CFX  Stock For Now,opinion,We have issued an updated research report on Colfax Corporation   NYSE CFX   on Feb 20  Exposure in emerging markets  focus on innovative products and buyouts gains will benefit Colfax in the years ahead  However  industry competition  rising costs and expenses remain prime concerns Colfax carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Its market capitalization is approximately  4 1 billion Colfax s financial performance was better than expected in two of the last four quarters and in line with expectations in the other two quarters  Average earnings surprise was a positive 4 74   Its Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at  2 12 for 2018 and  2 36 for 2019  representing growth of 2 9  and 3 5  from their respective tallies 30 days ago Below we briefly discussed the company s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds Factors Favoring ColfaxBuyouts Keys to Expansion  Over time  acquired assets have helped Colfax leverage benefit from easy penetration into unexplored markets and expanded product offerings  In 2017  TBi and HKS were added to the company s portfolio  While TBi is a leader in robotic torch technology  HKS is a developer of advanced process analytics and sensors  Since these were acquired  the buyouts have been strengthening the company s welding process analytics and robotic welding torches operations in the Fabrication Technology segment  In addition  acquisition of Siemens AG s Siemens Turbomachinery Equipment GmbH business has strengthened the company s Howden trading platform Notably  acquired assets increased the company s revenues by 2 7  in 2017 Long Term Growth Potential Solid  Colfax s focus toward the expansion of existing platforms and gaining exposure in new ones will work in its favor in the years ahead  Its two solid platforms are Fabrication Technology and Air   Gas Handling  These businesses have been serving customers in the oil   gas  general industrial  mining  marine and many others end markets  Also  the company is working hard on improving its operations in emerging markets including China  India  Brazil and others Over the long run  three to five years   the company anticipates organic growth in the range of 1 2  above GDP and segment margins in the mid teens level Impressive Projections for 2018  For 2018  Colfax anticipates that its Fabrication Technology business will gain from new products and its initiatives directed to improve customer service and operational efficiency while its Air   Gas Handling business will improve on the back of investment in growth markets and restructuring initiatives Adjusted earnings per share in the year are anticipated to be within the  2 00  2 15 range  increasing from  1 74 recorded in 2017  Organic revenue growth is predicted to be flat to up 2  Factors Working Against ColfaxRising Costs   Expenses  High Debts Remain Issues  Colfax is currently dealing with adverse impacts of rising costs and expenses  In the fourth quarter of 2017  its cost of sales grew 7 8  year over year while selling  general and administrative expenses expanded 17   Margin profile was weak in the quarter as gross margin slipped 20 basis points  bps  year over year and adjusted operating margin fell 200 bps  Moreover  the company s long term debt balance at the quarter end was approximately  1 1 billion  We believe  if unchecked  rising costs and expenses and high debt levels can prove to be detrimental to the company s profitability in the quarters ahead Threat From Industry Competition and International Expansion  Colfax s Air and Gas Handling business faces stiff competition from companies offering similar products and services or those producing different items for same uses  Also  other companies operating in the welding space provide stiff competition to its Fabrication Technology business In addition  international expansion has exposed the company to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies and geopolitical issues  Also  as the company has to procure raw materials from suppliers both in the United States and international markets  it remains vulnerable to price fluctuations associated with policies and issues of the source countries Headwinds From Global Uncertainty  End markets served by Colfax are highly susceptible to global economic conditions  Lower level of industrial activities and difficult financial conditions in countries  where the company operates  will adversely hurt its sales  earnings and cash flow

11272,232787,ROP,Here s Why You Must Hold On To Altra Industrial  AIMC  Stock,opinion,We issued an updated research report on Altra Industrial Motion Corporation   NASDAQ AIMC   on Feb 26  Strengthening of the end markets  focus on cost control and buyout gains are likely to benefit the company in the quarters ahead  However  industry competition  rising costs and expenses remain its prime concerns The stock carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold   Its market capitalization is approximately  1 3 billion Altra Industrial s financial performance was better than expected in three of the last four quarters and below expectations in one quarter  Average earnings surprise was a positive 11 13   The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year earnings is pegged at  2 44 per share  representing 5 2  growth from the tally a month ago Below we briefly discuss the company s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds Factors Favoring Altra IndustrialLong Term Growth Potential Solid  Altra Industrial s focus toward penetrating into the new and unexplored markets and expansion of existing ones will work in the stock s favor  The company s three business segments   Clutches   Brakes  Electromagnetic Clutches   Brakes and Gearing   serve various end markets including energy  general industrial  material handling  metals  mining  special machinery  turf and garden and transportation Also  measures undertaken to control costs and improving the margin profile will work in its favor  Per these restructuring and cost saving strategies  the company intends to lower the strength of its facilities by 20 30  and improve its supply chain worldwide In the long term  the company anticipates revenue growth in excess of the Gross Domestic Product while it aims to expand its operating margin by 150 basis points on strategic pricing Buyouts   Key to Expansion  Over time  acquired assets have helped Altra Industrial leverage benefit from easy penetration into markets and expanded product offerings  In December 2016  the company acquired Stromag   a well known tailored engineered solution provider for customers in various markets   from GKN  LON GKN  plc  The buyout added Stromag s products including clutches and brakes  flexible couplings  limit switches and friction discs to the company s portfolio  Notably  synergistic benefits from the Stromag acquisition contributed 20 3  to net sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 Impressive Projections for 2018  Altra Industrial Motion anticipates gaining from improvements in the majority of the end markets  especially in turf and garden  material handling  metals and mining plus a solid product portfolio The company s net sales are anticipated within  895  915 million range in 2018  above  876 7 million generated in 2017  While non GAAP earnings are projected at  2 30  2 43 per share  up from  2 05 in the previous year  Estimated tax rate of 25 27  will result in cash benefits of  3 7 million Factors Working Against Altra IndustrialRising Costs   Expenses Remain Issues  Altra Industrial is dealing with adverse impacts of rising costs and expenses  In the fourth quarter of 2017  its cost of sales grew 31 8  year over year while selling  general and administrative expenses rose 18 7   Moreover  research and development expenses increased 38 5   Margin profile was weak in the quarter as gross margin slipped 120 basis points  bps  year over year and non GAAP operating margin fell 30 bps  We believe  if unchecked  rising costs and expenses can be detrimental to the company s profitability in the quarters ahead Industry Competition and International Expansion  Altra Industrial faces stiff competition from companies offering similar products and services or those producing different items for same uses  Also  difficulties or delays in research and development or production and services  apart from the failure of new products and technologies in the market might hurt the company s competitive edge  In addition  global expansion has exposed the company to risks arising from negative movements in foreign currencies and geopolitical issues  Also  as the company has to procure raw materials from suppliers in both domestic and international markets  it remains vulnerable to price fluctuations associated with policies and issues of the source countries Headwinds From Global Uncertainty  End markets served by Altra Industrial are susceptible to global economic conditions  Lower level of industrial activities and difficult financial positions in countries wherein the company operates  are likely to affect its sales  earnings and cash flow In the last three months  Altra Industrial s shares have declined 5   underperforming 4 6  gain recorded by the it belongs to

meaningful buyouts are key drivers for the company  On the flip side  cost and debts  as well as risks related to international operations  remain concerns The company  with a market capitalization of approximately  7 9 billion  carries a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  Below  we briefly discussed the company s potential growth drivers and possible headwinds Factors Favoring NordsonShare Price Performance and Earnings Estimates Revision  Nordson s financial performance was better than expected in three of the last four quarters and in line with expectations in one quarter  Average earnings surprise was a positive 3 91  In the last three months  the company s shares have yielded 6 9  return  outperforming 1  decline of the  Underpinning the favorable sentiments reflects positive revisions in earnings estimates for the stock  In the last 30 days  five brokerage firms have raised estimates for both fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019  Currently  the stock s Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at  6 33 for fiscal 2018  ending October 2018  and  7 05 for fiscal 2019  ending October 2019   representing the growth of 0 8  and 2 8  from their respective tallies  30 days ago Near  and Long Term Growth Potential Solid  Nordson operates through three business segments   Adhesive Dispensing Systems  Advanced Technology Systems and Industrial Coating Systems   largely minimizing its risks of loss from poor performance of any single group  Also  a vast customer base in various end markets  including packaging  non wovens  polymer processing  products assembly  electronic systems  fluid management  test and inspection  container coating  curing and drying systems  liquid finishing and powder coating  is beneficial  Moreover  the company s commitment toward rewarding shareholders through dividends will continue building positive sentiments  In August 2017  the company hiked its quarterly dividend rate by 11  For second quarter fiscal 2018  the company anticipates sales to increase in the range of 9 13  year over year  including the 7  contribution from buyouts and 5  from favorable foreign currency movements Over the long term  2018 to 2023   the company anticipates revenue growth to be roughly twice the global GDP percentage while aiming to improve its operating margin in excess of revenue growth percentage Buyouts   Key to Expansion  Over time  acquired assets have helped Nordson penetrate into the new and unexplored markets and expand operations in existing ones  In calendar 2017  the company acquired certain assets of ACE Production Technologies  Inc   100  shares of Plas Pak Industries  Inc   InterSelect GmbH and Advanced Technologies business of Vention Medical  All these assets have strengthened the company s businesses under Advanced Technology Systems segment Further  the company acquired Sonoscan  Inc  in January 2018  while its subsidiary   Nordson ASYMTEK   added the PCP product lines of Infiniti Dosing o m s  to its portfolio in the same month  The

approximately  1 258 8 million while exiting the quarter  We believe  if unchecked  rising costs and expenses  and huge debt levels can be detrimental to the company s profitability in the quarters ahead Threats From International Expansion  Global expansion has exposed Nordson to risks arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies  Also  uncertainties in the economic growth of the countries served can severely impact the company s businesses  Notably  the company has operations in more than 35 countries with manufacturing facilities in the United States  the People s Republic of China  Germany  Mexico  Netherlands  Thailand and the United Kingdom Industry Competition  Nordson faces stiff competition from companies offering similar products and services or those producing different items for same uses  Also  difficulties or delays in research and development or production and services  apart from the failure of new products and technologies in the market  might hurt the company s competitive edge Some key players in the industry  sporting a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  are Applied Industrial Technologies  Inc    NYSE AIT    Dover Corporation   NYSE DOV   and Roper

11276,232791,ROP,Gain Exposure To Industrial Machinery With These 5 Stocks,opinion,The U S  market is abuzz with President Trump s import tariffs on steel and aluminium and its subsequent impact on various industries  Evidently  domestic steel and aluminium producing companies will emerge as prime winners while those using these metals as raw material and relying heavily on imports will likely lose  Industrial machinery  we believe  will likely feel the heat of the import tariffs in the form of higher production costs and rise in competitive threats from international players Despite these possible headwinds  we believe that the country s industrial machinery has strong growth potential and offers solid investment options for investors seeking exposure in the space  Before proceeding further  we like to mention here that industrial machinery is grouped under   one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors Industrial Products   At the ApexLast year  the sector gained 18 6  while it has rallied roughly 0 9  in the last three months  The industrial stocks  performance has been impressive in the fourth quarter of 2017  Earnings in the quarter grew 34 8  year over year while revenues increased 14 5   Both earnings and revenue beat in the quarter came in at 83 3  Currently  the sector is in the top 6   holding the first position among all the Zacks sectors  This clearly shows that the majority of the industries within this sector performed well in the past few months and looks poised for growth in the coming quarters  Per the  report dated Mar 7  earnings for industrial stocks are projected to grow 23 7  in the first quarter of 2018 while sales are likely to increase 12 3  Currently  the machinery industry dealing with material handling products and electrical products is in the top 2  of the 265 industries comprising the Zacks sectors while those dealing with construction and mining equipment and thermal products are in the top 5  Other machinery industry that primarily deals with manufacturing and supplying farm equipments is in the top 14   industrial electronics in 22   industrial tools and providing related services in 11  and companies serving general industrial purposes in 30  Going by the Zacks rule  we see that machinery sub industries mentioned above  fall in the top half  These sub industries can be of interest to investors seeking exposure in the machinery industry What s Driving Industrial Machinery We believe that healthy domestic requirements and strong export orders play a key role in determining the demand for industrial machineries in any country  Per the U S  Census Bureau report  new orders for U S  manufactured machinery increased 11 4  year over year in January 2018 led by growth in orders for farm  construction  mining  industrial  material handling and metal working machineries Also  the country s industrial production increased 3 7  year over year in January driven by impressive growth in mining  manufacturing and utilities output  The latest report issued by the Institute for Supply Management reveals that Purchasing Managers  Index or manufacturing index grew roughly 2 9  in February over the previous month  We believe that these economic indicators point toward healthy operating conditions in the industry Also  the U S  machinery companies will gain from the implementation of the government s  1 trillion investment plan for infrastructure improvement  strengthening housing market and new job additions  Moreover  efforts aimed to improve trade relations across nations will be a boon for machinery

11281,232796,WYND,Are Hotels Empty  Stocks Are Making It Look That Way,opinion,"That is what you would think from their stock charts  Hotel stocks are looking like every boss everywhere is about to mandate video conferencing instead of face to face discussions and families have all decided to go camping instead of a proper holiday this summer  Here are a few to look at 

Choice Hotels  CHH  is sitting on a support resistance zone that has been important since last July  With a Marubozu like candle Thursday and a falling RSI and MACD the prospects are for a breakdown and continuation lower  Under 43 70 the next support shows up at 41 70 and then 39 80 
I just stayed in a Hyatt  H  the other night and it was quite pleasant  crowded and generally buzzing  But the chart shows the stock is moving lower through a support zone with a falling RSI and MACD and a gap just a few points below 

Wyndham Worldwide Corp  NYSE WYN  is pressing on support as well  The RSI is on the edge of a move into bear territory with a MACD heading lower  both supporting the downside  and a cool 5  run to the 200 day SMA below

11282,232797,WYND,Is Hotel Industry In Honeymoon Period ,opinion,"The hotel industry has bounced back since the sales plunge during the global financial crisis  In spite of some economic and political blotches all over the world  sales have risen overall and are rather robust in the U S 
There are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the broader hotel industry over the short and medium term  Below  we discuss what investors can look forward to in the coming months and quarters Demand Exceeds Supply  The gradual recovery in the broader economy is a boon for the hotel industry as it has perked up leisure and transient business travel demand  With limited supply and strong demand  room rates are seeing an uptrend 
According to Hyatt Hotels Corporation Hyatt Hotels Corporation  NYSE H  and Hilton Worldwide  NYSE HLT   the supply demand environment in the U S  is favorable as demand growth is better than supply  which is still below the long term average  This would lead to rate increases  and thereby drive revenue per available room  RevPAR   In fact  despite the large pipeline of hotels  Smith Travel Research  STR  expects the sector s demand growth in 2015 to be 2 4  in the U S  with only 1 3  increase in supply The North American Recovery  System wide occupancies in North America appear pretty steady and are above the prior peak achieved in 2006 following the gradual economic recovery  Easier lending standards  and an improving travel and tourism industry  have also poised hotel companies for growth  For Starwood Hotels   Resorts Worldwide  NYSE HOT   North America is still the largest market where it plans to open most of its hotels  The company expects 2015 to be yet another year of robust growth in this region International Expansion  Major hoteliers are exploring growth opportunities abroad  especially in the emerging markets and in the outlying areas surrounding major cities  These markets offer greater potential due to the higher pace of economic growth  and the outlying mature markets that enjoy proximity to the city centER  A number of U S  based hoteliers are targeting the unsaturated markets of the Asia Pacific  Brazil  Russia and Africa  Within Asia  despite its economic slowdown  China promises lucrative growth opportunities with visits expected to increase substantially in 2015  In fact  China is a major revenue contributor to both Starwood Hotels and Marriot International  NASDAQ MAR  
The improvement in the Chinese tourism industry  propelled by increased discretionary income and relaxed visa restrictions from popular tourist destinations  is anticipated to be alarming in 2015 and beyond  Apart from China  India is becoming a hot spot for western hoteliers with its emergence as a global business hub  Although economic growth rates are slightly lower than China  India has great long term growth potential as a tourism market  Major players in the industry are also eying high potential countries such as Turkey  United Arab Emirates  UAE  and South Korea which offer strong infrastructure  Growth in Brazil and Argentina continue to be sluggish  despite the impact of the FIFA World Cup held in mid 2014  Brazil is scheduled to host another mega sporting event   2016 Summer Olympics   which should boost tourism  The European market is also improving  In fact  select markets in Southern Europe that were hit hard by the recession  are witnessing growth  The bullish trend can be validated by Starwood s system wide occupancy data in 2014  which was an impressive 69 2  in Europe  Other major players like Hilton Worldwide  Choice Hotels International  NYSE CHH  and Wyndham Worldwide  NYSE WYN  are also targeting the European market Brand Renovation to Boost Growth  Hotel companies are diligently working on guest satisfaction via brand conversion and re modeling to strengthen their positions amid tough competition  In fact  brand perception is likely to have a growing influence on the large mass market segment  With the market becoming increasingly saturated  hotels will need to increasingly differentiate themselves  Brands that can offer something uniquely compelling are likely to grab market share and the ability to innovate will be a key driver of success  Therefore  many leading hoteliers like Starwood Hotels  Marriott International  Belmond Ltd   BEL   Hyatt Hotels and Marcus Corporation  NYSE MCS  are firing on all engines to make their brands more relevant in today s environment Building Loyalty through Social Media and the Smartphone Technology  Digital innovation and social media are starting to play an increasingly important role in the hotel industry  Social media can enhance a brand s prospect by connecting directly with guests  especially the millennials  and can in turn lead to increased loyalty and market share  Social media sites like Facebook  NASDAQ FB   Twitter  NYSE TWTR  and TripAdvisor  NASDAQ TRIP  are increasingly playing an important role in helping travelers select a hotel  Moreover  a higher number of hoteliers are using apps to help guests manage their bookings  interactive maps GPS as well as reward programs  Being tech savvy is no longer an option but a necessity for the hotel industry  Many companies are setting up analytics tools to understand consumer preferences   and deliver a differentiated experience   which could eventually motivate customers to visit frequently  stay longer and spend more  Loyalty programs are the key to better brand experience and hoteliers are continuously reengineering these to provide a more fulfilling experience  Currently  Marriot Vacations Worldwide  NYSE VAC  and Intercontinental Hotels Group  LONDON IHG  Intercontinental Hotels Group  LONDON IHG  sport a Zacks Rank  2  Buy  
Despite being Zacks Rank  3  Hold  stocks  we are optimistic about Starwood  Hyatt Hotels  Marriott  Hilton Worldwide  and Choice Hotels  given the momentum in their underlying businesses and based on the optimistic outlook for 2015 Bottom Line We firmly believe that the dark days have passed for lodging sector which is now on a path to recovery  This makes it a worthy investment proposition for 2015 provided the economic recovery continues and the industry s the low supply high demand scenario stays  Although risks have continued to ease out  near term risks related to a slowdown in the emerging markets might remain an overhang  As you can see  there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the hotel industry for the long haul  But what about investing in the space right now  Check out our latest  for more on the current state of affairs in this market from an earnings perspective  and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now ",2015-03-20,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/is-the-hotel-industry-in-a-honeymoon-period-245680,245680

11286,232801,ROP,Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights  Caterpillar  Stanley Black   Decker  Deere  Roper Technologies And Rockwell Automation,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL   Dec 4  2017   Today  Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry  Industrial Machinery  including Caterpillar  Inc    NYSE CAT    Stanley Black   Decker  Inc    NYSE SWK    Deere   Company   NYSE DE    Roper Technologies  Inc    NYSE ROP   and Rockwell Automation Inc    NYSE ROK   Industry  Industrial MachineryLink  The cyclical nature of industrial machinery demand is benefiting from the synchronized global growth backdrop  The International Monetary Fund  IMF  recently raised its outlook for the global economy  with the financial institution anticipating the world economy to grow 3 6  in 2017  It expects 2 2  rise in advanced economies and 4 6  growth in emerging nations  Global output is projected to increase 3 7  in 2018  including 2  growth for advanced nations and 4 9  improvement for emerging countries We believe that continuous advancements in technologies applied in agriculture and mining industries keep demand strong for farming and mining machinery  Moreover  healthy growth in demand for packaged foods and beverages across nations  especially in emerging countries  are significantly increasing the use of highly sophisticated food processing and packaging equipment  Further  need for better infrastructure and residential and non residential spaces require heavy construction machineries Machinery stocks are broadly grouped under   one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors  The sector has performed well  yielding a solid return of 18 3  year to date  This outpaces growth of 16 9  recorded by the S P 500 and roughly 13 2  by the NYSE Composite Among the S P 500 members  the top five industrial machinery gainers since the beginning of the year include Caterpillar  Inc   Stanley Black   Decker  Inc   Deere   Company  Roper Technologies  Inc  and Rockwell Automation Inc Industrial Machinery  DescriptionIndustrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial machinery stocks  It measures the level of output of manufacturing  mining and utilities sectors in a country  A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below The United States  The country s industrial production increased2 9  year over year in October driven by impressive growth in mining  manufacturing and utilities output  In September  industrial production increased 1 6  year over year In addition  a few indicators point toward healthy operating conditions in the industry  Per the U S  Census Bureau report new orders for U S  manufactured machinery increased 6 4  in the first nine months of 2017 led by growth in orders for construction  mining  industrial  material handling and other machineries Also  the job market showed strength  with the recent data indicating 261 000 new job additions in October  Average of new job additions in the last three months was 162 000  accounting for hurricane affects   The unemployment rate dropped 10 basis points  bps  to 4 1   Also  the country s GDP has advanced 3  in the July September quarter We believe that implementation of the Trump government s growth policies  especially the proposed  1 trillion spending on infrastructure improvement  will be a boon for industrial machinery stocks  Other tailwinds are the strengthening housing and commercial construction markets in the country  To continue supporting the growing economy  the Federal Reserve has hiked its interest rates twice this year while another one might be expected in December The IMF projects the U S  economy to grow 2 2  in 2017 and 2 3  in 2018  These estimates represent increase of 10 bps from the previous projection for 2017 and 20 bps for 2018 Japan The country s economy is struggling with internal issues including low investment levels  an aging population and huge public debt Also  the consumption level has failed to revive to a satisfactory standard since it suffered from a 3  rise in national sales tax in April 2014 However  strengthening exports driven by rise in automobile and electronic shipments have supported the country s annualized GDP growth of 1 4  in the third quarter compared with the previous quarter  In addition  we believe that initiatives to improve wages are likely to spur domestic demand as well as steps to increase investments domestically might work in the country s favor in the quarters ahead According to the report from Japan s Cabinet Office  core machinery orders  an indicator of capital spending by companies in the next six to nine months increased 4 7  in third quarter 2017  However  the same is predicted to be quite different in the fourth quarter  with total machinery orders likely to decline 1 9   Core orders are expected to fall 3 5   orders from manufacturing clients will likely drop 9 4  and that from government clients might decline 3 3  The IMF increased its growth projection for the country by 20 bps to 1 5  for 2017 and by 10 bps to 0 7  for 2018 China China s GDP grew 6 8  from the year earlier period in the third quarter  However  this improvement was slightly below 6 9  registered in the previous quarter as a rise in retail sales and higher exports were partially offset by weak expansion in infrastructure investments The country s industrial production improved 6 6  year over year in September on the back of improvement in manufacturing and utilities sectors  offset by weakness in the mining sector  Industrial production in October grew 6 2  For 2017  the Chinese government anticipates economy to grow roughly 6 5   We believe that implementation of the government s plan to spend more than  2 trillion for the development of infrastructure and transportation by 2020 will boost the economy and spur demand for industrial machinery The IMF projects the Chinese economy to grow 6 8  in 2017 and 6 5  in 2018  up roughly 10 bps from the respective previous estimates India The country is currently witnessing the after effects of some major reforms  demonetization and goods and services tax   implemented in the trailing 12 months  These economic decisions along with other strategies to make the country a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world are expected to drive its economic growth going forward A favorable domestic job market  low interest rates allowing easy accessibility to cheap loans  infrastructure investments  healthy export demand and better monsoon conditions are additional factors that can make the country a favorable investment destination The country s industrial production decelerated to 3 8  in September 2017  having expanded 4 5  in the previous month  Production suffered from weakness in mining and electricity outputs  In the first half of fiscal 2017  ended September   industrial production expanded 2 5  year over year According to the IMF  the country is projected to grow 6 7  in 2017 and 7 4  in 2018  down roughly 50 bps and 30 bps from the respective previous estimates Brazil One of the major road blocks for the Brazilian economy are the political uncertainties which have gripped the nation  somewhat jeopardizing its growth opportunities  Corruption charges against its president are believed to be one of the reasons behind the country s poor investment grade ratings  Moreover  low private investments  inadequate infrastructure and still a high unemployment rate of 12 4  are other major hurdles Partially negating the impact of these aspects  growth in export demand and efforts to implement a new pension reform targeting the curbing of public debt are currently strengthening hopes of a turnaround in the Brazilian economy  Also  falling inflation have prompted the countries  Central Bank to ease interest rates  Notably  the interest rate has been lowered by 75 bps in October  this being its ninth consecutive rate cut since October 2016 In addition  the country s industrial production has been encouraging since the beginning of the year  Per the latest data  industrial production in September grew 2 6  from the year ago comparable month The IMF expects the country s output to grow 0 7  in 2017  reflecting a 40 bps increase from the previous forecast  Also  growth projection for 2018 has been increased by 20 bps to 1 5  Eurozone The region  amidst all the political uncertainties  is showing slight improvement in export demand and labor markets  The region s GDP has improved 2 5  year over year in third quarter 2017 while industrial production has improved 3 3  year over year in September  The unemployment rate at September end was 8 9  versus 9  at the end of the previous month

Leading Asian markets fell again with the Shanghai Composite Index closing with a 7 6  loss and the Nikkei 225 down 4 0   while other key Asian markets closed with milder losses and Hong Kong ended up in positive territory  European markets were broadly higher  led by the first rise in the FTSE 100 in 11 sessions  the FTSE closed up over 3   the Euro Stoxx 50 closed up 4 7 percent 
 has dropped 22  in the past 4 sessions  Today  their central bank responded by cutting interest rates for one year lending by 25 basis points to 4 6   while the one year deposit rate will fall a quarter of a percentage point to 1 75 percent  The required reserve ratio will be lowered by 50 basis points for all banks to cover funding gaps  China s surprise yuan devaluation on Aug  11 led to a tightening in liquidity as the PBOC subsequently bought its currency to stabilize the exchange rate and curb capital outflows 
Roughly  4 5 trillion has evaporated from the Chinese markets since the middle of June   real  tangible wealth that no longer exists  Equities on mainland Chinese exchanges still trade at a median reported earnings multiple of 60  times  The yuan may face more downside pressure as a result of the latest monetary easing  making it harder to keep depreciation in check  The US dollar rallied for the first time in 5 days 
Against that backdrop this morning  stocks on Wall Street rallied  The Dow Industrial Average gained over 441 points this morning  and for a fleeting moment it looked like the carnage of the past week was but a blip on the screen  It turned out to be a classic dead cat bounce  The Dow lost 646 points from the intraday high to the close  the biggest reversal to the downside since October 29  2008 
The Standard   Poor s 500 stock index closed down 1 4 percent  to 1 867  after earlier rising almost 3 percent from Monday s close  The S P 500 closed down 12 5 percent from its May high  the Dow ended down 14 6 percent from its May high  Not as bad as yesterday  but still plenty ugly  And the final hour of trading was just nasty  panicky stuff  about a 500 point loss on the Dow in one hour 
So it begs the question  what spooked the markets in the final hour  There are many catalysts in play in the market s turn  from fears about China to corporate earnings and commodity prices  toss in concerns about emerging market credit  But at the core  much of this plunge is about a loss of faith in cheap money stimulus  In China  the concern is that the people s Bank of China isn t responding with enough force  or that they have responded with too much force and it is backfiring  take your pick 
In the US  the concern is that the recovery should be stronger by now  and there is the threat of the Fed hiking interest rates at the mid September FOMC meeting  It all highlights just how addicted the markets are to cheap money stimulus from central banks  and how that addiction has distorted valuations 
So  for the moment we don t know what spooked the markets in the final hour of trade  Maybe it was just an algorithm that triggered  Maybe we put too much faith in a shoddy Chinese market that wasn t built to last and now looks like nothing more than a shiny knock off of western markets  Maybe too many people grew weary of the pep talks from financial advisers repeating the mantra  don t worry  you re in it for the long haul  it just dredges up old ghosts 
If the Financial Crisis of 2008 2009 taught us anything  it was a lesson in the fragility of the financial and capital markets and the stages of denial as market developments unfold  And just because stocks drop in price it doesn t mean they are cheap or on sale or great values  Maybe there were some big hedge funds that started forced liquidations when things turned south  Maybe traders remembered that the Fed could still hike rates next month  even in the maw of a market correction  I m still not sure why the Fed seems inclined to a rate hike but they seem to like the idea 
The economic news was decent enough  New U S  single family home sales rose a bit less than expected in July  Sales increased 5 4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 507 000 units  The stock of new houses for sale increased 1 9 percent to 218 000 last month  the highest level since March 2010  Still  supply remains less than half of what it was at the height of the housing boom  The median price of a new home rose 2 percent from a year ago to  285 900

Consumer confidence rebounded in August  The Conference Board said its index of consumer attitudes jumped to 101 5  up from a reading of 91 0 in July  In the report  Lynn Franco at the Conference Board said   Consumers  assessment of current conditions was considerably more upbeat  primarily due to a more favorable appraisal of the labor market   The uncertainty expressed last month about the short term outlook has dissipated and consumers are once again feeling optimistic about the near future  Income expectations  however  were little improved

The Congressional Budget Office says the US budget deficit is likely to fall by  60 billion in 2015 due to strong revenue gains  The CBO said it now estimates a  426 billion deficit for fiscal year 2015  down from its  486 billion forecast made in March  It also forecast a fiscal 2016 deficit of  414 billion  a reduction of  41 billion  The CBO says the government may be able to pay its bills without a debt limit hike through early December 
Oil prices managed a mild rally but couldn t close above  40 a barrel  API reported a huge 7 3 million barrel drawdown in oil inventories this week  against expectations of a build  and sparked a headline driven jerk higher in crude prices 
Oil prices dropping below  40 dollar a barrel sounds like a beautiful thing  It means cheap gas for your SUV and lower energy bills  At  2 60 a gallon  gas is now about a dollar below where it was last year at this time  And it could continue to fall  Eleven states now have gas prices under  2  When President Obama predicted in his State of the Union Address in January that  the typical family this year should save  750 at the pump   he was probably right  Multiply that by the nation s 115 million households and you get a total savings of over  86 billion  That s huge 
Lower gas prices help poor people in particular  households with incomes of less than  50 000 spent 21  of their income on energy in 2012  while households earning more than  50 000 spent 9   Additionally  Americans who live in chillier regions like New England and the Midwest could save another  750 or so on energy bills  The bad news is largely restricted to the Dakotas  Texas  Oklahoma  and Alaska  And when oil prices are low  we tend to use more gas  we loosen up on conservation  demand increases and that  of course  leads to higher prices  not all at once  but slowly  over time

11293,232808,AX,Can Value Investors Consider AXOS FINANCIAL  AX  Stock Now ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put AXOS FINANCIAL INC  COMMON STOCK   NYSE AX   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  AXOS FINANCIAL has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 10 89  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares quite favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 stands at about 17 13  Also  if we focus on the long term PE trend  AXOS FINANCIAL s current PE level puts it much below its midpoint of 14 08 over the past five years Also  the stock s PE compares favorably with the Finance Market s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 13 75  This indicates that the stock is quite undervalued right now  compared to its peers Moreover  AXOS FINANCIAL has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 10 59  which is slightly lower than the current level  So  it is fair to say that a more value oriented path may be ahead for Southern  NYSE SO  First stock in the near term too P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  AXOS FINANCIAL has a P S ratio of about 2 87  This is a bit lower than the S P 500 average  which comes in at 3 07x right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is much below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  AXOS FINANCIAL currently has

4 Winning Stocks to Buy on Earnings Acceleration
As we are in the thick of the earnings season  investors should look for stocks that are ready to make a big move  Consistent earnings growth enthralls almost everyone  right from the top brass to research analysts  Upbeat earnings results are more often than not followed by an uptick in the share price 
But earnings acceleration works even better in boosting the stock price  Studies have shown that majority of successful stocks see acceleration in earnings before a positive stock price movement 
Future Outperformers
Basically  earnings acceleration is the incremental growth in earnings of a company  In other words  if the rate of a company s quarter over quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time  it can be referred to as earnings acceleration 
In case of earnings growth  you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price  But  earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven t caught the attention of investors yet  which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price  This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates 
Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time  On the other hand  a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown  while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down 
This is the reason why earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance

11298,232813,RHI,Why Robert Half  RHI  Is A Top Dividend Stock For Your Portfolio,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Robert Half in Focus
Based in Menlo Park  Robert Half  RHI  is in the Business Services sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 3 27   Currently paying a dividend of  0 31 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2 1   In comparison  the Staffing Firms industry s yield is 1 16   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 87  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 24 is up 10 7  from last year  In the past five year period  Robert Half has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 11 81   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Right now  Robert Half s payout ratio is 33   which means it paid out 33  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
RHI is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  3 98 per share  with earnings expected to increase 10 25  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for many reasons  they greatly improve stock investing profits  decrease overall portfolio risk  and carry tax advantages  among others  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
Big  established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  but it s fairly uncommon to see high growth businesses or tech start ups offer their stockholders a dividend  During periods of rising interest rates  income investors must be mindful that high yielding stocks tend to struggle  With that in mind  RHI is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-07-16,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/why-robert-half-rhi-is-a-top-dividend-stock-for-your-portfolio-200440903,200440903

11313,232828,TEX,China s Zoomlion sweetens offer for U S  crane maker Terex  sources,news,"By Greg Roumeliotis  Reuters    China s Zoomlion Heavy Industry Science   Technology Co Ltd  000157 SZ  has raised its bid for U S  crane maker  Terex Corp   N TEX   according to people familiar with the matter  as it challenges Terex s merger with Finland s  Konecranes   HE KCR1V   Zoomlion s latest move shows corporate China s determination to acquire U S  assets and expand its global footprint  Another Chinese company  Anbang Insurance Group Co  is trying to disrupt hotel operator Marriott International Inc s  O MAR  merger with peer  Starwood Hotels   N HOT   Zoomlion s main stumbling block in its negotiations with Terex is the price  rather than concerns that the United States could block the deal because of Terex s ties to the U S  military and presence in U S  ports  the people familiar with the matter said this week  Zoomlion has increased its offer to more than  3 4 billion by adding a special dividend for Terex shareholders of  1 per share to its previous  30 per share cash offer  the people said  Terex has responded by asking for  32 75 per share in cash to terminate its merger agreement with Konecranes and agree to sell itself to Zoomlion  the sources said  The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential  Terex shares jumped as much as 12 percent on the news and were trading up 7 3 percent at  23 38 in New York on Tuesday  Terex has argued privately that the synergies with Konecranes in the material handling and port systems businesses of the two companies mean Terex is worth more in the long term than what Zoomlion has offered  Reuters reported last month  In response to this  Zoomlion has also discussed offering Terex shareholders some type of security that would allow them to benefit from any upside in the potential deal  as opposed to completely cashing out  the sources said  Among the ideas that Zoomlion suggested are so called contingent value rights  that would entitle Terex shareholders to specific payments or other benefits if the combined company s shares or financial performance met certain targets  or a public stub  which would allow Terex shareholders to retain some equity  the people said   The sources said that Terex  however  has rejected these ideas as too complicated  and this prompted Zoomlion to come back with its increased cash offer of  31 per share  Terex has also held conversations with some of its shareholders who have privately asked it to continue to negotiate a deal with Zoomlion  the people said   The sources added that among these shareholders is activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp  which in its most recent filing with U S  regulators revealed it had acquired a small stake in Terex in the fourth quarter of 2015  The discussions between Terex and Zoomlion have not advanced beyond price  the people said  Zoomlion s banks  including China Development Bank and the Export Import Bank of China  are waiting for Terex to provide the access they require for their due diligence in order to finalize their financing commitments  the same sources said  The sources said there is no certainty that Terex and Zoomlion will be able to bridge their price differences and agree to a deal  Terex and Zoomlion declined to comment  Konecranes  Elliott  China Development Bank and the Export Import Bank of China did not immediately respond to requests for comment  WEAK MARKET FOR CRANES The battle for Terex coincides with weak demand in the market for cranes  driven by low oil and gas prices and foreign exchange volatility  Terex reported 2015 fourth quarter income from continuing operations of  14 6 million on net sales of  1 6 billion  versus income from continuing operations of  79 9 million on net sales of  1 8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014  Konecranes has offered 0 8 of its shares for each Terex share  It has argued that the two companies can face the downturn in their cyclical industry more effectively if they join forces  and that the shareholders of the combined companies will reap substantial profits in an upturn  Westport  Connecticut based Terex has 97 so called priority rated contracts with the U S  government that could attract scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States  CFIUS   It also provides mobile harbor cranes in ports that are seen as a critical part of U S  infrastructure  However  Terex is not treating CFIUS as an issue that would preclude any deal with Zoomlion  The value of Terex s priority rated government contracts is small and not material to Terex s business  Reuters reported in January  The company s ports business in North America is also small  with its biggest contract being a  75 million order for automated equipment at the Long Beach port in California  Zoomlion is a publicly listed company  with the Chinese province of Hunan as its biggest shareholder with a roughly 16 percent share  It is led by researcher turned entrepreneur Chunxin Zhan  who founded Zoomlion in 1992 with seven other partners with a loan of 500 000 yuan   77 000   Zoomlion now has a market value of 31 8 billion yuan   4 9 billion   It has acquired significant stakes in six other companies in five countries over the last two decades  and is now present in more than 80 countries

11320,232835,RHI,Robert Half  RHI  Earnings Expected To Grow  Should You Buy ,opinion,"The market expects Robert Half  RHI  to deliver a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2019  This widely known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company s earnings picture  but a powerful factor that might influence its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call  it s worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This staffing firm is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 96 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  20  
Revenues are expected to be  1 50 billion  up 7 4  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction  
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Robert Half 
For Robert Half  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Robert Half will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Robert Half would post earnings of  0 91 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 95  delivering a surprise of  4 40  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Robert Half doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-04-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/robert-half-rhi-earnings-expected-to-grow-should-you-buy-200407227,200407227

11322,232837,RHI,This Is Why Robert Half  RHI  Is A Great Dividend Stock,opinion,"Whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns  But when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
Cash flow can come from bond interest  interest from other types of investments  and of course  dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long term returns  with dividend contributions exceeding one third of total returns in many cases 
Robert Half in Focus
Based in Menlo Park  Robert Half  RHI  is in the Business Services sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of 8 57   Currently paying a dividend of  0 31 per share  the company has a dividend yield of 2   In comparison  the Staffing Firms industry s yield is 1 27   while the S P 500 s yield is 1 9  
Looking at dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 24 is up 10 7  from last year  Robert Half has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 11 49   Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Robert Half s current payout ratio is 31   meaning it paid out 31  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
RHI is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  3 98 per share  with earnings expected to increase 10 25  from the year ago period 
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  RHI is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-04-25,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/this-is-why-robert-half-rhi-is-a-great-dividend-stock-200411783,200411783

Factors at Play
Roper Technologies  business has been affected because of the weakness in the oil and gas sector  In addition  unexpected project delays in certain traffic and toll projects continue to weigh on its financials  Roper also expects its business to be negatively impacted by Brexit and other macroeconomic headwinds  As a result in the last quarter  the company slashed its guidance for 2016 
Nonetheless  the company s asset light business model and robust M A activity will likely provide some respite in the long run  The company s strong dividend policy is also an added positive 
For the third quarter of 2016  Roper Technologies expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of  1 59    1 63

11330,232845,RHI,Here s Why You Should Retain IQVIA Holdings  IQV  Stock Now,opinion,A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks  At times  it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions One such stock is IQVIA Holdings Inc    NYSE IQV     which has gained 50 3  in the past year  outperforming the 26 3  rally of the  it belongs to and 10  rise of the Zacks S P 500 composite  It has an expected long term  three to five years  earnings per share growth rate of 14   Moreover  earnings are expected to register 14 4  growth in 2019 and 14 7  growth in 2020 However  the company faces its share of headwinds  A high debt laden balance sheet may limit its future expansion and worsen its risk profile  International presence exposes the company to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  In spite of these headwinds  we believe that the company has enough positives that justify the stock s retention in investors  portfolio Factors Driving IQVIA HoldingsSolid Technological Suite and Strategic CollaborationsIQVIA Holdings looks strong on the back of its

through integrated clinical and commercial solutions  two new site portal technology capabilities to streamline clinical trial communications  a SaaS eConsent tool for use in clinical trials and development of SaaS safety platform  aimed at lowering cost and complexity of pharmacovigilance and enhancing organization s focus on patient safety are the other major positives Growth Opportunities From Emerging MarketsIQVIA Holdings serves the life sciences industry  a major part of the global healthcare system  with the help of advanced analytics  technology solutions and contract research services  The company s vast geographic presence should act as a boon  IQVIA Institute projects spending on pharmaceuticals in emerging markets to witness compound annual growth rate  CAGR  of 5 8  through 2023 The company expects multiple acquisition opportunities across the industry  Life sciences organizations are expected to commercialize their operations in emerging markets just as they did in the developed markets  This growing presence in emerging markets like Asia Pacific and Africa will provide more growth opportunities for IQVIA Holdings in the life sciences industry Shareholder Friendly MovesWe are impressed with IQVIA Holdings  consistent efforts to reward its shareholders in the form of share repurchases  In 2018  IQVIA Holdings repurchased shares worth  1 41 billion  On

11331,232846,AX,Daily Watch List  Are Things Overheating ,opinion,"The list was somewhat lackluster yesterday with only a few standouts that took off right from the open which made them hard to own  Google Inc  NASDAQ GOOGL   Baidu Inc  NASDAQ BIDU   Natus Medical Incorporated  NASDAQ BABY  were the few that stood out 
The market is gapping higher this morning and will become officially overheated today by the close based on one of Pradeep Bonde most trusted indicator   What you usually see when this indicator flashes a caution signal is junk stocks start to fly for the next few days and then you see choppiness   retracement over the next week or so   So far this year this indicator has flashed a signal on  1 2 1 3     1 8 1 23    2 25    3 3 3 12    6 18 6 19   6 30    7 2    This signal is most dangerous and actionable shorting wise when it persist for a few days like it did at the beginning of the year   But at the same time it provides a big opportunity for oversize gains in what many consider junk stocks   I will keep you updated on this indicator 
The watch list today is rather short and based on this morning gap up I would assume not many will be actionable

Every morning I go through a few of my scans to find buy candidates for the day   Depending on the current state of the market the size of the list will vary  usually its no more than 50 names   My process is based on market structure not on beliefs or myths of what works  or what doesn t work   They are certain behavioral patterns that have been around for 100 years that are based on market structure  these behavioral patterns are recognizable  observable  and quantifiable   On daily basis we have 5 000 stocks that we filter based on certain market structures that gives us an edge of a higher probability than a random outcome   Once the list is narrowed to a handful of names the market will further narrow down the list by getting us in or keeping us out of these names with a range expansion move 
 I don t look at charts in your conventional cookie cutter manner  or have rules as to where the stock should be whether its 15  off its 52 week highs or above or below certain moving averages etc 
These are what I consider  tight set ups  that will trigger a buy signal for me if  and only when they break the previous day s high   On a regular trading day I would indiscriminately take every trigger because you just don t know which one will be the big winner  you might have an idea but in the end you don t know 
How much you put at risk per trade depends for the most part what your current outlook is for the market over the next 0 5 days 
Put these names on your trading platform  set the alerts at yesterday s high for each name  once the alert goes off take a look at the chart  decided within 3 seconds whether or not you are going to buy it  decide how much you want to risk on the trade and your stop loss  hit the buy button  and leave the rest up to the market  wash  rinse  repeat

Technologies Holdings Inc    NASDAQ SSNC   Excellent Dividend Growth Stocks to Buy NowThe return of volatility with the escalation of global growth concerns and the risk of recession in the United States has raised the appeal for dividend growth stocks  This is because dividend paying securities are the major sources of consistent income when returns from the equity market are at risk While there are several dividend stocks that could provide capital appreciation  zeroing in on the stocks that not only pay dividends but also consistently increase the payout ratio could be some excellent choices   Dividend Growth  A Winning StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market  and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility  At the same time  these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term  These include a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future Moreover  a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields  Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock For the rest of this Screen of the Week article

11338,232853,RHI,Depend On DuPont Analysis   Pick 5 Top Stocks ,opinion,"Return on equity is an investor favorite metric when it comes to cherry picking quality stocks  But ROE doesn t always tell the complete story and an investor might make a mistake by selecting stocks based on this ratio   Thus  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level or applying the DuPont  NYSE DWDP  technique seem a prudent decision 
Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of the 12 stocks that made it through the screen 
Medifast Inc   NYSE MED    This company has a Zacks Rank of 1 and is a leading manufacturer and distributor of clinically proven healthy living products and programs  It belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 41    You can see  
Foot Locker Inc    NYSE FL    This company carries a Zacks Rank  2 and is a leading global retailer of athletically inspired shoes and apparels  It belongs to a favorably ranked Zacks sector  top 38

11341,232856,RHI,6 Excellent Dividend Growth Stocks To Buy Now,opinion,"The return of volatility with the escalation of global growth concerns and the risk of recession in the United States has raised the appeal for dividend growth stocks  This is because dividend paying securities are the major sources of consistent income when returns from the equity market are at risk While there are several dividend stocks that could provide capital appreciation  zeroing in on the stocks that not only pay dividends but also consistently increase the payout ratio could be some excellent choices   Dividend Growth  A Winning StrategyStocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies  which are less susceptible to large swings in the market  and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility  At the same time  these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts Additionally  these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term  These include a sustainable business model  a long track of profitability  rising cash flows  good liquidity  a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics  Further  a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase is likely in the future Moreover  a history of dividend growth year over year leads to a healthy portfolio with a greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those with high yields  Although these stocks do not necessarily have the highest yields  they have outperformed for a longer period than the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock As a result  picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included 5 Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero  This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history 5 Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue 5 Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero  This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history Next 3 5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero  This represents the rate at which a company s earnings are expected to grow  Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments Price Cash Flow less than M Industry  A ratio less than M industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company 52 Week Price Change greater than S P 500  Market Weight   This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S P 500 over the past one year Top Zacks Rank  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  and 2  Buy  generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment  of B or better  Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks

11342,232857,RHI,Zacks com Featured Expert Kevin Matras Highlights  Medifast  Foot Locker  Comfort Systems  EMCOR And Robert Half International,opinion,"For Immediate Release
Chicago  IL   March 29  2019  Stocks in this week s article include Medifast Inc   NYSE MED    Foot Locker Inc    NYSE FL    Comfort Systems USA Inc    NYSE FIX    EMCOR Group Inc    NYSE EME   and Robert Half International Inc    NYSE RHI    Kevin Matras screens for companies showing their  first  profit and explains why they are ones to watch Screen of the Week written by Kevin Matras of Zacks Investment Research Depend on DuPont  NYSE DWDP  Analysis with These Top 5 Stocks
Return on equity is an investor favorite metric when it comes to cherry picking quality stocks  But ROE doesn t always tell the complete story and an investor might make a mistake by selecting stocks based on this ratio   Thus  taking a step beyond the basic ROE and analyzing it at an advanced level or applying the DuPont technique seem a prudent decision 
Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income Equity
Net Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity 
ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
Although one can t play down the importance of normal ROE calculation  the fact remains that it doesn t always provide a complete picture  The DuPont analysis  on the other hand  allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis

11348,232863,TEX,UPDATE 3 Deere outlook overshadows Q3 beat  shares fall,news,"  Fiscal Q3 better than expected
   Full year forecast implies disappointing Q4
   Shares down in early trading
  Adds details on outlook  background  updates shares 
 By James B  Kelleher
 CHICAGO  Aug 19  Reuters    Deere   Co reported a
higher than expected third quarter profit as improved
profitability in its core agriculture machinery business helped
to offset weakness in construction and forestry equipment 
 But the company said it expected to barely break even in
the current quarter  sending its shares down more than 4
percent in early trading 
 The world s largest maker of tractors and harvesters  which
is cutting production in anticipation of lower demand next
year  reported a third quarter profit of  420 million  or 99
cents a share  down from  575 2 million  or  1 32 a share  last
year  Sales fell 24 percent to  5 89 billion 
 Analysts  on average  had expected the company to report a
profit of 56 cents per share on sales of  5 27 billion 
 Analyst Eli Lustgarten of Longbow Research called the
results  a clean beat   although 20 cents of the earnings came
from nonoperating items  including a lower tax rate 
 Moline  Illinois based Deere reiterated its forecast for a
full year net profit of  approximately  1 1 billion  
 Since Deere has already reported earnings of  1 1 billion
for the first nine months of the year  the guidance implied a
break even or possibly even a marginally unprofitable fiscal
fourth quarter 
  They re burying the fourth quarter with these production
cuts   Lustgarten said   And so their guidance is for a
marginally break even quarter  
 Analysts had expected Deere to report a fourth quarter
profit of 33 cents a share  according to Reuters Estimates 
 Deere also cut its forecast for corn prices for the
2009 2010 crop year to  3 40 a bushel  down from a previous
forecast of  3 80  That s up from its current price of about
 3 12 a bushel but down 59 percent from the record highs it
touched last summer 
 Since farm equipment purchases are highly correlated with
crop prices and the cash receipts they represent  that was
likely to translate into less demand for the tractors and
harvesters produced by Deere and its top rivals  Fiat Spa
subsidiary CNH Global NV and Agco Corp 
 With demand from farmers easing  that puts added pressure
on Deere s construction and forestry unit  which competes with
Caterpillar Inc  Komatsu Ltd and Terex Corp  and has seen
demand drop sharply as a result of the worldwide downturn in
building 
 Deere shares fell about 4 3 percent  or  1 96  to  43 13 in
early New York Stock Exchange trading

11350,232865,RHI,The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights  Robert Half  Virtu  Interpublic  CH Robinson And AXA,opinion,For Immediate ReleaseChicago  IL  March 22  2019   Zacks com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog  Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets  Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Robert Half International Inc    NYSE RHI    Virtu Financial  Inc    NASDAQ VIRT    The Interpublic Group of Companies  Inc    NYSE IPG    CH Robinson Worldwide Inc    NASDAQ CHRW   and AXA Equitable Holdings  Inc    NYSE EQH    Here are highlights from Thursday s Analyst Blog  5 Services Stocks Offering Excellent DividendsAmerica s equity market rally seems to be in trouble  After starting the year on a strong note  stocks have been faced with several roadblocks  the latest of which is the ambiguity over trade negotiations  The Dow has been in negative territory since late February and may remain there unless a trade deal comes through However  services stocks continue to present a lucrative opportunity  The primary factor powering the sector at this point is a resilient U S  economy with a strong jobs  market  Incidentally  services provide 80  of all private sector jobs Additionally  several services sector stocks sport strong and stable dividends  This offers investors steady income flows during volatile trading conditions  They also offer diversification across a variety of industries  This is why it makes sense to invest in services stocks at this point    Record Deficit in Goods  Surplus in ServicesFresh data released earlier this month conclusively proves that Trump s protectionist stance has failed to address the U S  trade balance problem  In 2018  the U S  trade deficit in goods touched a record level of  891 billion  This is nearly  100 billion more than the record achieved in 2015 during the Obama era Conversely  the United States runs a massive surplus in services  This amounted to nearly  270 billion in 2018  It comes as no surprise then that services finds no place in the current U S  China trade negotiations Like most mature  developed countries  the United States is essentially a services based economy  Private services make up almost 90  of U S  GDP and account for more than 80  of all the private sector employment generated So essentially  services draw their power from the state of the U S  economy  which at this point has shown great resilience in the face of a global slowdown  And this dynamic makes a very strong case for services Bullish Services Sector Data  Resilient EconomyThe ISM services index increased from 56 7 in January to 59 7 in February  The reading also exceeded the consensus estimate of 57 3 by a significant margin  In effect  the services sector recovered from a lackluster January and expanded for the 109th straight month  Notably  all 18 non manufacturing industries  which make up the sector  experienced expansion And despite talk of a slowdown  the second estimate for fourth quarter GDP revealed that the U S  economy had expanded by 2 6  during this period  This follows an extremely good 2018 for the economy during which it expanded at an annual pace of 3  for the first time since 2005 Further  bolstering the case against a dramatic economic slowdown is the latest data on consumer sentiment  The preliminary reading for the University of Michigan s consumer sentiment gauge increased from 93 8 to 97 8 in March This indicates that the economy has likely successfully recovered from a government shutdown induced slump which caused the gauge to fall to 91 2 in January  its lowest level since October 2016  With the economy in good shape  the case for services becomes even more bullish Our ChoicesThe equity market rally has run into trouble due to uncertainty over the progress of U S  China trade negotiations  which are essentially for a dispute over the flow of goods  However  it is crucial to note that the United States holds a clear edge when it comes to services  Also  services contribute a major chunk of GDP and the lion s share of private sector jobs Further  the U S  economy is in good shape and shows no imminent signs of a slowdown  This is why it makes sense to invest in services sector stocks that also promise strong and stable dividends  This helps to ride out the bumps created by ongoing trade disputes  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score  We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM

11351,232866,ROP,Weekly Preview  Focus Shifts From Earnings To Economy,opinion,In the upcoming week  the focus of markets will gradually shift from earnings to the economy  especially later in the week  as key reports including the ECB rate decision and the U S  Non Farm Payrolls report are expected to be released   Key Earnings In the coming week  key earnings from Facebook  FB   Time Warner  TWX   MasterCard  MA   Visa  V   and Newmont Mining  NEM  will be in focus FacebookFacebook is expected to report first quarter EPS of  0 126 vs   0 09 a year ago on Wednesday  May 1  Revenue is expected to come in at  1 44 billion for the quarter compared to  1 058 billion in the same period a year ago Analysts at Wedbush weighed in on the stock ahead of the release   We expect Q1 results at or above consensus  Our current estimates are for revenue of  1 43 billion and EPS of  0 10  compared to consensus of  1 44 billion and  0 12  respectively  The company did not provide guidance   We expect top  line growth to be driven by mobile ad revenue  up 100  q o q to over  300 million in Q4 12  and a slew of targeted ad initiatives  including Custom Audiences and Facebook Exchange   FBX    After launching last September  FBX served nearly 1 billion impressions from over 1 300 advertisers per day by December  EPS growth will likely be driven by operating expense below the levels implied by management   We do not expect management to provide additional FY 13 guidance  On its Q4 12 results call  management cautioned investors to expect opex to increase by   50  in FY 13  We have modeled slightly below this level  as we believe the company has more control over expenses than revenues  By providing such high  level guidance  management provides itself with the flexibility to still deliver a positive earnings result through opex control even if revenue lags expectations   Maintaining our OUTPERFORM rating and our price target of  35  Our price target reflects a value of  60 per MAU at Facebook s peak MAU level with a conservative monetization assumption of  1 per MAU per month for five years  Time WarnerTime Warner is expected to report first quarter EPS of  0 744 vs   0 682 a year ago on Wednesday as well  Revenue is expected to come in at  7 126 billion compared to  6 979 billion in the same period a year ago The analysts at Wedbush also weighed in on this stock ahead of the earnings   For 1Q  we maintain our  0 75  Street   0 74  estimate  as we believe a solid ad market performance at least offset mild box office disappointments  Although we trim our 1Q film estimates  we expect any resulting EBIT shortfall to be offset by Networks  where we believe ad trends have been fairly good   We expect TWX to reaffirm 2013 guidance of low double digit EPS growth  For 2013  we remain comfortable with our assumption that Turner can gain share in a U S  cable ad market tracking to be up  4   and maintain our subscription revenue growth estimate of 6    Raising 12 month price target to  63 from  60 on updated sum of the parts valuation  risks  Our revised SoTP analysis  reflecting a reduced conglomerate discount on account of TWX s plan   announced in March   to split off publishing by year end  supports our PT  MastercardMastercard is expected to report first quarter EPS of  6 17 on Wednesday vs   5 36 a year ago  Revenue is expected to come in at  1 933 billion compared to  1 758 billion in the same period a year ago Analysts at Sterne Agee weighed in ahead of the earnings   With intra quarter data points trending largely as anticipated  we are expecting in  line results for 1Q13  Our EPS estimate of  6 12 is  0 06 below consensus  Foreign currency could have a slightly higher impact than we are modeling  but overall  we are not expecting any major surprises with the results   We will be watching MA s debit volume closely as it appears that Visa is starting to win back some of its lost share  We will also be interested to hear MA s views on the Visa Chase partnership   We recently downgraded MA shares to Neutral from Buy based on  1  the valuation  which we now view as fair  21x 2013E EPS  and in line with where we expected the stock price to reach  and 2  a general lack of positive catalysts in the business   On the margin  we believe that some relative momentum has shifted to Visa and MasterCard faces tougher comps over the next few quarters as it grows over prior debit wins  In addition  we do not see any substantial upside to consensus EPS expectations  VisaVisa is expected to report EPS of  1 81 for the first quarter on Wednesday vs   1 49 a year ago  Revenue is expected to be  2 852 billion compared to  2 547 billion in the same period a year ago The analysts at Sterne Agee also weighed in on Visa ahead of its earnings as well   Visa is scheduled to report F2Q13  March  results on May 1 after the close with a call at 5 00 pm EST  With card volume data points largely as anticipated during the quarter  we are expecting generally in line results and believe that Visa will reiterate its FY13 guidance   We forecast F2Q13 EPS of  1 81  in line with consensus  and revenue of  2 846bn  just below consensus of  2 852bn  We forecast some margin compression from stepped up advertising and marketing spend   March quarter card data trends appear in line  showing a little catch up in March after a weaker than expected February  but strong January  Major card issuers reported average volume growth of 8  y y in the quarter  down from  11  in the December quarter  We had anticipated some slowing at the start of the year due to the increased payroll taxes this year and the delay in Federal tax refunds   We recently downgraded Visa to Neutral from Buy as shares approached our prior  175 price target  We now view the shares as fairly valued and expect the shares to perform in line with the S P 500 over the coming months  Our positive fundamental view on Visa remains unchanged as we still view the stock as the single best long term way to play the secular growth in electronic payments  Newmont MiningNewmont Mining is expected to report first quarter EPS of  0 77 vs   1 14 a year ago on Monday  Revenue is expected to fall to  2 29 billion from  2 683 billion in the same period a year ago Analysts at Deutsche Bank commented on the stock ahead of the earnings   We expect Newmont to report 1Q13 adjusted diluted EPS of  0 75   32  QoQ   35  YoY  on lower volumes  both gold and copper   lower gold prices and higher cash costs  DBe EPS is 4c below FactSet consensus of  0 78   10c in past 2 weeks   However  we estimate a potential miss to DBe EPS of 8 10c based on production and sales figures released by Newmont on April 17th  with gold sales volume of 1 1m oz which were  7  lower than DBe   Newmont recently announced next quarterly dividend of  0 35 share   18  QoQ  payable on June 27th  If gold prices average  1400 1499 oz in 2Q13  dividend for 3Q13 would decline further to  0 25 share   29  QoQ   implying annualized yield of  Focus will likely be on  1  construction milestones at Akyem  late 2013 start  up   2  already announced divestment of final 7  stake in Batu Hijau

11352,232867,ROP,Bulls All Dressed Up  But Might Have No Place To Go,opinion,"Stock market bulls made a valiant effort to fight off another looming correction last week  The economy is showing strong signs of recovery  the Fed remains confident enough to continue its stimulus tapering  and attractive alternative investments to the U S  stock market seem scarce  Yes  bulls are all dressed up for more fun times  However  the technical picture paints a different story  at least for the near term  So don t back up the truck just yet  Caution is in order 
Thursday showed improving manufacturing data  personal income and spending  Friday s Government Employment Situation report showed that 288 000 joined the payrolls  University of Michigan Consumer Confidence jumped to the highest level since last July  Oil and gas are plentiful  The US dollar is relatively weak  helping the multinationals  earnings  Pending home sales rebounded in March  the first increase in nine months  Global hot spots  e g   Ukraine  Iraq  Afghanistan  continue to push global investors into the U S  The 10 year Treasury yield continued to fall  closing Friday at 2 58   And as discussed below  Sabrient s fundamentals based sector rankings are bullish 
Indeed  the CIO of the California State Teachers  Retirement System has stated that the nation s second largest public pension fund can t figure out where to invest  183 billion outside of U S  equities  Even though stocks might be getting fatigued  the firm sees few attractive alternatives in which to invest 
So  the setup is clear for an improving economy and growing GDP  But that doesn t mean the stock market will continue to go straight up from here  Near term technicals are worrisome  margin debt has reached an all time high  and trading volume in highly speculative penny stocks has soared to new highs 
The CBOE Market Volatility Index  VIX   a k a   fear gauge   closed last week at 12 91 and remains firmly below the 15 threshold  indicating low investor trepidation about their stocks  But from a contrarian basis  it is once again oversold and ready to spike up at any time  Buy to open call volume on VIX futures is near record levels  meaning that the  smart money  has taken on a risk reduction mindset that makes the major resistance levels hard to crack 
My view is that the market is poised to endure a significant pullback soon before hitting new highs later in the year 
SPY chart review 
The SPDR S P 500 Trust  ARCA SPY  closed Friday at 188 06  which is up nicely from last week and appears to have negated the head and shoulders pattern  However  this doesn t mean that all is well again in Whoville  Thursday and Friday were uninspiring  and Friday s candlestick looked quite bearish    a red engulfing pattern with a long upper shadow  Overhead resistance is strong  Oscillators RSI  MACD  and Slow Stochastic all appear to be rolling over  and there is a gap up on April 16 from about 184 that will act as a magnet to be filled and tested  Minor support sits nearby at 187  but the 50 day simple moving average is likely the first level of strong support  near 186   followed by the convergence of gap support at 184 with the 100 day SMA  Below that is the bottom of the long standing uptrend  currently near 180  and then the 200 day SMA  around 178  

The broad market indexes have struggled to break through strong round number resistance  including the S P 500 at 1 900 and the Wilshire 5000 at 20 000  Also  the Russel 2000 and Nasdaq are struggling from far below their March highs 
Latest sector rankings 
Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model  which builds a composite profile of each equity ETF based on bottom up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks  The  Outlook Score  employs a forward looking  fundamentals based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation  historical and projected earnings growth  the dynamics of Wall Street analysts  consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions  up or down   quality and sustainability of reported earnings  forensic accounting   and various return ratios  It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1 3 months 
In addition  SectorCast computes a  Bull Score  and  Bear Score  for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days  High Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong  while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well   safe havens   when the market is weak 
Outlook score is forward looking while Bull and Bear are backward looking  As a group  these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions  Of course  each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights  so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used  We use the iShares that represent the ten major U S  business sectors  Financial  iShares US Financials  IYF    Technology  iShares Dow Jones US Technology  IYW    Industrial  iShares US Industrials  IYJ    Healthcare  iShares US Healthcare  IYH    Consumer Goods  iShares US Consumer Goods  IYK    Consumer Services  iShares US Consumer Services  IYC    Energy  iShares DJ US Energy Sector Fund  IYE    Basic Materials  iShares US Basic Materials  IYM    Telecommunications  iShares US Telecommunications  IYZ    and Utilities  iShares US Utilities  IDU    Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S P 500  I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity  Fidelity also offers a group of sector ETFs with an even larger number of constituents in each 

Here are some of my observations on this week s scores 
1   Technology remains in first place with a robust Outlook score of 87  Industrial stays in second place with a 58  Technology generally displays solid factor scores across the board  with a strong forward long term growth rate  a reasonable forward P E  the highest return ratios  and positive sentiment among Wall Street analysts  upward revisions to earnings estimates   although insider sentiment is only moderate  insider buying activity   Industrial displays a good forward long term growth rate  solid return ratios  and strong sentiment among sell side analysts  Energy and Financial round out the top five 
2   Telecommunications returns to the cellar with an Outlook score of 0 as it is at or very near the bottom in every factor in the model  It is joined in the bottom two once again by Consumer Services Discretionary with a score of 13 
3   Looking at the Bull scores  Technology is the leader at 59  while Utilities is by far the laggard with a low score of 43  In fact  Utilities is the only sector scoring below 50 this week  The top bottom spread 16 points  reflecting relatively low sector correlations on particularly strong market days    although it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see a top bottom spread of at least 20 points  which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the stocks they want to hold  rather than the  all boats lifted in a rising tide  mentality that we saw during 2013 
4   Looking at the Bear scores  Utilities continues to increase  this week scoring 74  which means that stocks within this defensive sector have been the preferred  safe havens  on weak market days  Technology scores the lowest at 45  The top bottom spread is a robust 29 points  reflecting very low sector correlations on particularly weak market days  Again  it is generally desirable in a healthy market to see a top bottom spread of at least 20 points 
5   Technology displays the best all weather combination of Outlook Bull Bear scores  while Telecom is the worst  Looking at just the Bull Bear combination  Utilities is the leader solely on the strength of its Bear score  but Energy is close behind as it now displays solid Bull and Bear scores  indicating superior relative performance  on average  in extreme market conditions  whether bullish or bearish   Consumer Services scores by far the lowest  indicating general investor avoidance during extreme conditions 
6   Overall  this week s Outlook rankings still look bullish  with five of the top six sectors also displaying high Bull scores  the exception is Utilities   Notably  the Bull score for Energy has transitioned to the higher end  so this sector now can be considered in the bullish camp once again 
These Outlook scores represent the view that Technology and Industrial sectors are relatively undervalued  while Consumer Services and Telecom may be relatively overvalued based on our 1 3 month forward look   
Stock and ETF Ideas 
Our Sector Rotation model  which appropriately weights Outlook  Bull  and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market s prevailing trend  bullish  neutral  or bearish   suggests holding Technology  Industrial  and Energy in the prevailing bullish climate   In this particular model  we consider the bias to be bullish from a rules based standpoint because SPY is still above its 50 day simple moving average while also remaining above its 200 day SMA  
Other ETFs that are ranked high by our algorithm from the Technology  Industrial  and Energy sectors include PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Portfolio  PSI   SPDR S P Transportation ETF  XTN   and PowerShares Dynamic Energy Exploration   Production Portfolio  PowerShares Dynamic Energy E P  PXE  
For an  enhanced  sector portfolio that enlists top ranked stocks  instead of ETFs  from within Technology  Industrial  and Energy  some long ideas include Zillow Inc  Z O   SanDisk Corp  NASDAQ SNDK   Roper Industries  NYSE ROP   Middleby Corp  NASDAQ MIDD   Valero Energy  NYSE VLO   and Whiting Petroleum  WLL   All are ranked highly in the Sabrient Ratings Algorithm and also score within the top quintile of our   which is a pure accounting based risk assessment signal based on the forensic accounting expertise of our subsidiary Gradient Analytics  We have found EQR quite valuable for helping to avoid performance offsetting meltdowns in our model portfolios 
However  if you are more comfortable with a neutral bias  the model suggests holding Technology  Industrial  and Utilities  On the other hand  if you have a bearish outlook on the market  the model suggests holding Utilities  Energy  and Consumer Goods Staples

11357,232872,RHI,Robert Half  RHI  Is A Top Dividend Stock Right Now  Should You Buy ,opinion,"All investors love getting big returns from their portfolio  whether it s through stocks  bonds  ETFs  or other types of securities  However  when you re an income investor  your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments 
While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments  income investors hone in on dividends  A dividend is the distribution of a company s earnings paid out to shareholders  it s often viewed by its dividend yield  a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price  Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long term returns  and in many cases  dividend contributions surpass one third of total returns 
Robert Half in Focus
Based in Menlo Park  Robert Half  RHI  is in the Business Services sector  and so far this year  shares have seen a price change of  2 64   The staffing firm is currently shelling out a dividend of  0 31 per share  with a dividend yield of 2 23   This compares to the Staffing Firms industry s yield of 1 26  and the S P 500 s yield of 2 03  
In terms of dividend growth  the company s current annualized dividend of  1 24 is up 10 7  from last year  Over the last 5 years  Robert Half has increased its dividend 5 times on a year over year basis for an average annual increase of 11 49   Looking ahead  future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio  which is the proportion of a company s annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend  Robert Half s current payout ratio is 33   meaning it paid out 33  of its trailing 12 month EPS as dividend 
RHI is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is  3 98 per share  which represents a year over year growth rate of 10 25  
Bottom Line
Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons  from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits  However  not all companies offer a quarterly payout 
High growth firms or tech start ups  for example  rarely provide their shareholders a dividend  while larger  more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options  Income investors must be conscious of the fact that high yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates  With that in mind  RHI is a compelling investment opportunity  Not only is it a strong dividend play  but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3  Hold  ",2019-05-28,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/robert-half-rhi-is-a-top-dividend-stock-right-now-should-you-buy-200426079,200426079

11364,232879,RHI,Believe In DuPont Analysis  Tap These 5 Top Ranked Stocks,opinion,"If you have to isolateprofit churners from profit burners  return on equity will come across to you as one of the most appropriate metrics  It is a profitability ratio that measures the earnings that a company generates from its equity 
But ROE doesn t tell the complete story and an investor might get fooled by picking stocks based on this number  If you closely look at the components of ROE  you will be surprised to see that it can be high for the wrong reasons as well  Here comes the DuPont  NYSE DWDP  technique which helps investors to analyze basic ROE at an advanced level  Here is how DuPont breaks down ROE into its different components 
ROE   Net Income EquityNet Income   Equity    Net Income   Sales     Sales   Assets     Assets   Equity ROE   Profit Margin   Asset Turnover Ratio   Equity Multiplier
Why Use DuPont 
The DuPont analysis allows investors to assess the elements that play a dominant role in any change in ROE  It can help investors to segregate companies having higher margins from those having a high turnover  For example  high end fashion brands generally survive on high margin as compared with retail goods  which rely on higher turnover 
In fact  it also sheds light on the company s leverage status  which can go a long way in selecting stocks poised for gains  A lofty ROE could be due to the overuse of debt  Thus  the strength of a company can be misleading if it has a high debt load 
So  an investor confined solely to an ROE perspective may be confused if he or she has to judge between two stocks of equal ratio  This is where DuPont analysis wins over and spots the better stock 
Investors can simply do this analysis by taking a look at the company s financials However  looking at financial statements of each company separately can be a tedious task  Screening tools like Zacks Research Wizard can come to your rescue and help you shortlist the stocks that look impressive with a DuPont analysis 
Screening Parameters  Profit Margin more than or equal to 3  As the name suggests  it is a measure of how profitably the business is running  Generally  it is the key contributor to ROE   Asset Turnover Ratio more than or equal to 2  It allows an investor to assess management s efficiency in using assets to drive sales   Equity Multiplier between 1 and 3  It s an indication of how much debt the company uses to finance its assets   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2  Stocks having a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy  or 2  Buy  generally perform better than their peers in all types of market environment   Current Price more than  5  This screens out the low priced stocks  However  when looking for lower priced stocks  this criterion can be removed Here are five of 11 stocks that made it through the screen 
Robert Half International Inc     NYSE RHI     This Zacks Rank  1 company is one of the world s largest specialized staffing firms  The stock belongs to a top ranked Zacks industry  top 13    You can see

5 Services Stocks Offering Excellent Dividends
America s equity market rally seems to be in trouble  After starting the year on a strong note  stocks have been faced with several roadblocks  the latest of which is the ambiguity over trade negotiations  The Dow has been in negative territory since late February and may remain there unless a trade deal comes through 
However  services stocks continue to present a lucrative opportunity  The primary factor powering the sector at this point is a resilient U S  economy with a strong jobs  market  Incidentally  services provide 80  of all private sector jobs 
Additionally  several services sector stocks sport strong and stable dividends  This offers investors steady income flows during volatile trading conditions  They also offer diversification across a variety of industries  This is why it makes sense to invest in services stocks at this point    
Record Deficit in Goods  Surplus in Services
Fresh data released earlier this month conclusively proves that Trump s protectionist stance has failed to address the U S  trade balance problem  In 2018  the U S  trade deficit in goods touched a record level of  891 billion  This is nearly  100 billion more than the record achieved in 2015 during the Obama era 
Conversely  the United States runs a massive surplus in services  This amounted to nearly  270 billion in 2018  It comes as no surprise then that services finds no place in the current U S  China trade negotiations 
Like most mature  developed countries  the United States is essentially a services based economy  Private services make up almost 90  of U S  GDP and account for more than 80  of all the private sector employment generated 
So essentially  services draw their power from the state of the U S  economy  which at this point has shown great resilience in the face of a global slowdown  And this dynamic makes a very strong case for services 
Bullish Services Sector Data  Resilient Economy
The ISM services index increased from 56 7 in January to 59 7 in February  The reading also exceeded the consensus estimate of 57 3 by a significant margin  In effect  the services sector recovered from a lackluster January and expanded for the 109th straight month  Notably  all 18 non manufacturing industries  which make up the sector  experienced expansion 
And despite talk of a slowdown  the second estimate for fourth quarter GDP revealed that the U S  economy had expanded by 2 6  during this period  This follows an extremely good 2018 for the economy during which it expanded at an annual pace of 3  for the first time since 2005 
Further  bolstering the case against a dramatic economic slowdown is the latest data on consumer sentiment  The preliminary reading for the University of Michigan s consumer sentiment gauge increased from 93 8 to 97 8 in March 
This indicates that the economy has likely successfully recovered from a government shutdown induced slump which caused the gauge to fall to 91 2 in January  its lowest level since October 2016  With the economy in good shape  the case for services becomes even more bullish 
Our Choices
The equity market rally has run into trouble due to uncertainty over the progress of U S  China trade negotiations  which are essentially for a dispute over the flow of goods  However  it is crucial to note that the United States holds a clear edge when it comes to services  Also  services contribute a major chunk of GDP and the lion s share of private sector jobs 
Further  the U S  economy is in good shape and shows no imminent signs of a slowdown  This is why it makes sense to invest in services sector stocks that also promise strong and stable dividends  This helps to ride out the bumps created by ongoing trade disputes  However  picking winning stocks may be difficult 
This is where our  comes in  Here V stands for Value  G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores  Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners  However  it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score

11366,232881,RHI,The election ate their homework  CEOs blame campaign for weakness,news,"By Caroline Valetkevitch and Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK  Reuters    Apparently  Americans are too distracted or distraught by this year s wild presidential campaign to think about getting a dishwasher  buying an RV or opening a doughnut shop  And the topsy turvy race could be crimping furniture sales  hotel bookings and even temporary help hiring  At least that is the word from a clutch of corporate executives in recent weeks who have laid at least some blame for their companies  rocky performances or uneven consumer demand at the feet of constantly bickering White House contenders Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump  Since the start of October  executives from more than 80 U S  companies have made some mention of the U S  election during quarterly conference calls with Wall Street analysts and investors  based on a Reuters analysis of call transcripts   In many cases  their remarks have come in response to specific questions from call participants about whether the long campaign season has had an impact on results  Some  though  have specifically pointed to the election as a factor in their earnings  including by damping consumer or business spending  For example  appliances maker Whirlpool  N WHR  and coffee and doughnuts chain Dunkin  Brands  O DNKN  have directly blamed the elections as a drag on their business  Shares of both companies fell after their reports  In Whirlpool s case  CEO Jeff Fettig pointed to apparent  temporary softness in industry demand  in the United States in explaining why sales dipped around 0 5 percent from a year earlier  undershooting Wall Street s forecasts   We believe this is due to consumer confidence weakening  primarily due to the focus around the U S  elections   he told analysts on the appliance maker s conference call last month  At Dunkin  Brands  CEO Nigel Travis cited a hesitance by franchise operators to open new stores until they get a grip on how the election outcome will affect regulations and minimum wage laws  Executives at other companies  such as furniture chain Ethan Allen  N ETH   staffing firm Robert Half International  N RHI  and hotel operator  Hilton Worldwide   N HLT   have cited the election as a pressure point as they discussed the business climate   The election  really has impacted customers and clients  It s taken a tremendous amount of attention from especially discretionary budgets   said Farooq Kathwari  chairman  president and CEO of Ethan Allen Interiors  N ETH   DOSE OF SKEPTICISM  But just as voters often take campaign promises with a healthy dose of skepticism  some investors and even a few executives themselves are not taking the talk of risks from the election season seriously   I think companies with underwhelming results are looking for convenient excuses  and the attention being paid by the American public to this election is certainly a timely and readily available excuse   said Michael James  managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles    Whether or not that s true is debatable  I d be taking it with a grain of salt   The vitriolic race between Republican Trump and Democrat Clinton has been tight  and some executives said consumers appeared to be waiting on decisions until Tuesday s Election Day passes    As we near an election date in early November  there s no doubt that I think consumers are  certainly with all discretionary purchases  maybe just taking a look at what s going to happen here in the next couple of months   said Winnebago Industries  N WGO  CEO Michael Happe on the company s conference call last month  His observation came even as motorhome maker Winnebago s sales and earnings for the quarter ended in late August topped Wall Street estimates  Hilton  meanwhile  cut its outlook for a key revenue metric  citing weak business travel   This cycle of election     I think it s been an unusual cycle and as a consequence I think it has slowed down the economy probably more dramatically than I ve seen certainly in my adult life   Hilton CEO Christopher Nassetta said on a conference call last month   Evercore ISI analyst Rich Hightower  who covers lodging companies including Hilton  said the election was a  relevant  point for executives to bring up  but he was not factoring any election impact into his financial forecasts  U S  consumer spending did fall in both August and September  the latest government data showed  and a key gauge of retail sales has posted a decline of around 0 1 percent on average over the three months through September  Still  Paul Nolte  portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago  questioned whether the campaign was having an effect on consumer behavior    I can t imagine it s created a kind of catatonic state for consumers to stop buying   said Nolte  And some C suite denizens have no patience for such excuses  Patrick McHale  CEO of pumps and spray equipment maker Graco  N GGG   told his conference call listeners he had not heard of  a single customer  holding off on an investment because of the election  McHale continued   In fact  if I heard somebody at Graco tell me that they were going to make an investment in something but they weren t because they want to see what was going to happen with the election  I d probably fire them

11378,232893,AX,Is BofI Holding  BOFI  A Great Stock For Value Investors ,opinion,Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment  After all  who wouldn t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys  or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios  many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process  Let s put BofI Holding  Inc    NASDAQ BOFI   stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value oriented investors right now  or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio  or PE for short  This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock  and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world  The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock s current PE ratio with  a  where this ratio has been in the past  b  how it compares to the average for the industry sector  and c  how it compares to the market as a whole On this front  BofI Holding has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12 6  as you can see in the chart below This level actually compares somewhat favorably with the market at large  as the PE for the S P 500 compares in at about 21 2  If we focus on the stock s long term PE trend  the current level puts BofI Holding s current PE ratio above its midpoint over the past five years Further  the stock s PE also compares favorably with the industry s trailing twelve months PE ratio  which stands at 19 8  At the very least  this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now  compared to its peers We should also point out that BofI Holding has a forward PE ratio  price relative to this year s earnings  of 11 5  so it is fair to say that a slightly more value oriented path may be ahead for BofI Holding s stock in the near term too   P S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price Sales ratio  This approach compares a given stock s price to its total sales  where a lower reading is generally considered better  Some people like this metric more than other value focused ones because it looks at sales  something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings Right now  BOFI has a P S ratio of about 3 7  This is lower than the industry s average  which comes in at 5 right now  Also  as we can see in the chart below  this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years If anything  this suggests some level of undervalued trading at least compared to historical norms Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate  BofI Holding currently has a Value Style Score of A  putting it into the top 20  of all stocks we cover from this look  This makes BOFI a solid choice for value investors  and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too For example  the PEG ratio for BofI Holding is just 1 2  a level that is lower than the industry average of 2  The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock s earnings growth rate  Additionally  its P CF ratio  another great indicator of value  comes in at 13 9  which is better than the industry average of 15 8  Clearly  BOFI is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles What About the Stock Overall Though BofI Holding might be a good choice for value investors  there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name  In particular  it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of D and a Momentum score of B  This gives BMRC a VGM score or its overarching fundamental grade of B   You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  Meanwhile  the company s recent earnings estimates have been discouraging  The current year and next has seen one upward estimate revision in the past sixty days compared to two downward As a result  the current year consensus estimate has dropped 1 2  in the past two months  while the next year estimate has also decreased 0 4   You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below BofI Holding  Inc  Price and Consensus   This negative trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank  3  Hold  despite strong value metrics and why we are looking for in line performance from the company in the near term Bottom LineBofI Holding is an inspired choice for value investors  as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front  Moreover  a decent industry rank  Top 43  out of more than 250 industries  further supports the growth potential of the stock   In fact  over the past three months  the industry has clearly outperformed the broader market  as you can see below  However  given the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions  value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first  but once that happens  this stock could be a compelling pick More Stock News  This Is Bigger than the iPhone

11383,232898,RHI,Robert Half  RHI  To Report Q2 Results  Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,opinion,"Wall Street expects a year over year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Robert Half  RHI  reports results for the quarter ended June 2019  While this widely known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company s earnings picture  a powerful factor that could impact its near term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates 
The earnings report might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations  On the other hand  if they miss  the stock may move lower 
While management s discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations  it s worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise 
Zacks Consensus Estimate
This staffing firm is expected to post quarterly earnings of  0 98 per share in its upcoming report  which represents a year over year change of  10 1  
Revenues are expected to be  1 52 billion  up 4 1  from the year ago quarter 
Estimate Revisions Trend
The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days  This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period 
Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change 
Price  Consensus and EPS Surprise

Earnings Whisper
Estimate revisions ahead of a company s earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out  Our proprietary surprise prediction model    the Zacks Earnings ESP  Expected Surprise Prediction     has this insight at its core 
The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter  the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate  The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information  which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier 
Thus  a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate  However  the model s predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only 
A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat  particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank  1  Strong Buy   2  Buy  or 3  Hold   Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70  of the time  and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP 
Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss  Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and or Zacks Rank of 4  Sell  or 5  Strong Sell  
How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Robert Half 
For Robert Half  the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate  suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate  This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0  
On the other hand  the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of  3 
So  this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Robert Half will beat the consensus EPS estimate 
Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue 
While calculating estimates for a company s future earnings  analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates  So  it s worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number 
For the last reported quarter  it was expected that Robert Half would post earnings of  0 96 per share when it actually produced earnings of  0 93  delivering a surprise of  3 13  
Over the last four quarters  the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times 
Bottom Line
An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower  Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors  Similarly  unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss 
That said  betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success  This is why it s worth checking a company s Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release  Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they ve reported 
Robert Half doesn t appear a compelling earnings beat candidate  However  investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release ",2019-07-15,Zacks Investment Research,https://www.investing.com/analysis/robert-half-rhi-to-report-q2-results-wall-street-expects-earnings-growth-200440160,200440160
